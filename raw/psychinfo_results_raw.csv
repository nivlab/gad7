"A community-based cross-sectional study of sleep quality among internal migrant workers in the service industry.","Yang, Xi; You, Liqin; Jin, Dong; Zou, Xiaowei; Yang, Haichen; Liu, Tiebang","Comprehensive Psychiatry",="0010440X",,="20200201","97",,,,"2020-07366-001","10.1016/j.comppsych.2019.152154","Elsevier Science","Journal Article","Anxiety; Foreign Workers; Insomnia; Mental Health; Sleep; Business; Major Depression; Resilience (Psychological); Risk Factors; Quality of Services; Adolescence (13-17 yrs); Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs); Thirties (30-39 yrs); Middle Age (40-64 yrs); Aged (65 yrs & older); Male; Female",,"Background: Internal migrant workers in the service industry are an important population in China, but the sleep quality of this population has not been well studied. The aims of the present study were to examine the prevalence of poor sleep quality among internal migrant workers in the service industry, explore the risk factors associated with poor sleep quality, and assess the correlation between insomnia and psychiatric factors. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in Shenzhen, a migrant city in China. The respondent-driven sampling (RDS) method was used to recruit participants. Sociodemographic data and physical and psychiatric health status were investigated using questionnaires. In total, 1756 internal migrant workers completed the questionnaires. The Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to assess sleep quality, the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scales were used to assess anxiety and depression, respectively. Mental resilience was assessed by the Chinese version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC). Regression analysis was used to identify the risk factors of poor sleep quality. A structural equation model (SEM) was used to analyze the relationships among sleep, anxiety, depression and resilience. Results: The prevalence of poor sleep quality among internal migrant workers in the service industry was 25.4%. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that participants who were older (OR = 1.452), worked > 8 h per day (OR = 1.553), had experienced physical illness in the past 2 weeks (OR = 3.631) and had psychiatric problems such as anxiety (OR = 1.695–3.331) and depression (OR = 1.437) had an increased risk of poor sleep quality (P < 0.05). Moreover, the risk of poor sleep quality increased as the severity of anxiety increased. We also detected sex-specific risk factors and depression associated with sleep quality in women (OR = 1.480, P < 0.05) but not in men. The SEM showed that sleep was mutually correlated with anxiety (r = 0.277, P < 0.001), depression (r = 0.301, P < 0.001), and resilience (r = −0.103, P < 0.001). Resilience was mutually correlated with anxiety (r = −0.179, P < 0.001) and depression (r = −0.222, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Our study indicated that poor sleep quality was common among internal migrant workers in the service industry. Older age, long working hours, and poor physical and psychiatric health status contributed to poor sleep quality. Compared to males, sleep quality in females was more likely to be impacted by depression. Optimum working hours and physical and psychological health are critical to improving sleep quality. Interventions for ameliorating sleep quality might have different priorities for males and females.

Methods: The characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients who completed online treatment at the MindSpot Clinic between January 2014 and December 2016 and reported a country of birth other than Australia were compared to Australian-born users. Data about the main language spoken at home were used to create distinct groups. Changes in symptoms of depression and anxiety were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 Item (GAD-7), respectively. Results: Of 52,020 people who started assessment at MindSpot between 1st January 2014 and 22nd December 2016, 45,082 reported a country of birth, of whom 78.6% (n = 35,240) were Australian-born, and 21.4% (n = 9842) were born overseas. Of 6782 people who completed the online treatment and reported country of birth and main language spoken at home, 1631 (24%) were migrants, 960 (59%) were from English-speaking countries, and 671 (41%) were from non-English speaking countries. Treatment-seeking migrant users reported higher rates of tertiary education than Australian-born users. The baseline symptom severity, and rates of symptom reduction and remission following online treatment were similar across groups. Conclusions: Online treatment was associated with significant reductions in anxiety and depression in migrants of both English speaking and non-English speaking backgrounds, with outcomes similar to those obtained by Australian-born patients. DMHS have considerable potential to help reduce barriers to mental health care for migrants.

A major limitation, however, is that the script cannot be easily modified. Aims: The current study assessed the feasibility of a brief guided internet-based written exposure therapy (iWET) for hypothetical fears, Mind at Peace. Method: Fifty-three adults presenting clinical levels of anxiety (GAD-7 ≥ 8) and worry (PSWQ ≥ 45) were recruited. A single group pre-test/post-test design including a 3-month follow-up was used. Mind at Peace is a 6-week iWET consisting of psychoeducation and five 30-minute weekly writing exposure sessions. Feasibility outcome measures included treatment adherence, attrition, treatment acceptability and preliminary efficacy. Primary outcome measures were the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ). Results: Attrition was higher (57%) and adherence lower (28%) than expected. Intent-to-treat repeated measures ANOVAs revealed significant and large improvements on the GAD-7 (ηp² = 0.36) and the PSWQ (ηp² = 0.23) with similar findings among study completers. Remission rates were higher on the GAD-7 than on the PSWQ, suggesting that Mind at Peace may primarily target general symptoms of generalized anxiety. Rates of acceptability varied, but nearly all study completers reported that they would recommend this treatment to a friend. Conclusions: This study provided valuable information on Mind at Peace. Methodological changes are proposed to improve its feasibility. A more definitive trial incorporating suggested methodological improvements is recommended.

Methods: An 8 week double-blind randomised clinical trial, in which 97 adults self-reporting mild to moderate anxiety were given 500 mg b.d. CFE (n = 49), or 500 mg b.d. placebo (n = 48). Anxiety and stress were measured at baseline, week 4, and week 8 to investigate the timing of treatment effect using the GAD-7, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and salivary cortisol. Data were analysed using mixed ANOVAs on SPSS v.24. Results: Results indicated a significant reduction in anxiety and stress in both groups at week 4 and week 8. The reduction in the CFE group was significantly greater (p < .05) than in the placebo group on the GAD-7 and PSS at week 4 and week 8, and in Negative affect at week 4. Improvement in Positive affect was greater in the CFE group than in the placebo group at week 8. Cortisol analysis indicated that CFE may act through the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis, showing statistically significant changes in males, but not in females. Limitations: Self-reported instruments involve subjective interpretation thus salivary cortisol was employed as a more objective measure. The study would benefit from a larger sample and longer trial, and the inclusion of a wait-list group to allow comparison between treatment and no treatment. Conclusions: The findings indicate that CFE is superior to placebo in reducing subclinical anxiety and stress over 8 weeks.

Objective: The aim of this study was to determine if a multicomponent, moderated Web-based mental health application could benefit individuals with mental health symptoms severe enough to warrant specialized mental health care. Methods: A multicenter, pragmatic randomized controlled trial was conducted across several outpatient mental health programs affiliated with 3 hospital programs in Ontario, Canada. Individuals referred to or receiving treatment, aged 16 years or older, with access to the internet and an email address, and having the ability to navigate a Web-based mental health application were eligible. A total of 812 participants were randomized 2:1 to receive immediate (immediate treatment group, ITG) or delayed (delayed treatment group, DTG) access for 3 months to the Big White Wall (BWW), a multicomponent Web-based mental health intervention based in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. The primary outcome was the total score on the Recovery Assessment Scale, revised (RAS-r) which measures mental health recovery. Secondary outcomes were total scores on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire-7 item (GAD-7), the EuroQOL 5-dimension quality of life questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L), and the Community Integration Questionnaire. An exploratory analysis examined the association between actual BWW use (categorized into quartiles) and outcomes among study completers. Results: Intervention participants achieved small, statistically significant increases in adjusted RAS-r score (4.97 points, 95% CI 2.90 to 7.05), and decreases in PHQ-9 score (−1.83 points, 95% CI −2.85 to −0.82) and GAD-7 score (−1.55 points, 95% CI −2.42 to −0.70). Follow-up was achieved for 55% (446/812) at 3 months, 48% (260/542) of ITG participants and 69% (186/270) of DTG participants. Only 58% (312/542) of ITG participants logged on more than once. Some higher BWW user groups had significantly greater improvements in PHQ-9 and GAD-7 relative to the lowest use group. Conclusions: The Web-based application may be beneficial; however, many participants did not engage in an ongoing way. This has implications for patient selection and engagement as well as delivery and funding structures for similar Web-based interventions.

Method: Collaborative Care patients (n = 17) used a smartphone app to transmit PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores and sensor data to a dashboard used by one care manager. Patients completed usability and satisfaction surveys and qualitative interviews at 4weeks and the care manager completed a qualitative interview. Mobile metadata on app usage was obtained. Results: All patients used the app for 4 weeks, but only 35% (n = 6) sustained use at 8 weeks. Prior to discontinuing use, 88% (n = 15) completed all PHQ-9 and GAD-7 measures, with lower response rates for daily measures. Four themes emerged from interviews: understanding the purpose; care manager's role in supporting use; benefits of daily monitoring; and privacy / security concerns. Two themes were user-specific: patients' desire for personalization; and care manager burden. Conclusions: The feasibility and acceptability of the mobile platform is supported by the high early response rate, however attrition was steep. Our qualitative findings revealed nuanced participant experiences and uncovered some concerns about mobile health. To encourage retention, attention may need to be directed toward promoting patient understanding and provider engagement, and offering personalized patient experiences.

The current study aims to determine acceptability and effectiveness of 4-session, large, Cognitive Behaviour Therapy with Mindfulness (CBTm) classes. Methods: A retrospective chart review of adult outpatients (n = 523) who attended CBTm classes from 2015 to 2016. Classes were administered in a tertiary mental health clinic in Winnipeg, Canada and averaged 24 clients per session. Primary outcomes were (a) acceptability of the classes and retention rates and (b) changes in anxiety and depressive symptoms using Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9) scales. Results: Clients found classes useful and > 90% expressed a desire to attend future sessions. The dropout rate was 37.5%. A mixed-effects linear regression demonstrated classes improved anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 score change per class = − 0.52 [95%CI, − 0.74 to − 0.30], P < 0.001) and depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score change per class = − 0.65 [95%CI, − 0.89 to − 0.40], P < 0.001). Secondary analysis found reduction in scores between baseline and follow-up to be 2.40 and 1.98 for the GAD-7 and PHQ-9, respectively. Effect sizes were small for all analyses. Conclusions: This study offers preliminary evidence suggesting CBTm classes are an acceptable strategy to facilitate access and to engage and maintain clients’ interest in pursuing CBT. Clients attending CBTm classes experienced improvements in anxiety and depressive symptoms. Symptom improvement was not clinically significant. Study limitations, such as a lack of control group, should be addressed in future research.

Methods: Our pilot study uses a cohort approach with multimodal data (clinical, social, structural [3T magnetic resonance imaging], and functional [electroencephalogram]). We screened 105 patients referred to the Halifax First Seizure Clinic between 2014 and 2016 and 51 controls. All participants completed two screening questionnaires: Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item. After applying the exclusion criteria, the study population consisted of 57 patients with unprovoked first seizure and 31 controls.

Aims: To establish the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among offshore workers working for an oil and gas company and to identify the main stressors that lead to symptoms of these disorders. Methods: One thousand seven hundred and forty-seven workers employed in an offshore oil and gas company in the Middle East completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and Patient Health (PHQ-9) questionnaires. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were estimated from these surveys. Results: Anxiety and depression symptoms were reported by nearly 15% of workers surveyed. Ordered logistic regression analyses showed that age, rotation length, years of service and local origin (versus expatriate) were significant predictors for symptoms of anxiety. With adjustment for age, older local workers had a lower risk of anxiety symptoms than expatriates. Conclusions: Younger workers, workers with longer rotations and those with fewer years of service were more likely to report anxiety symptoms. In addition, older local workers and expatriates had a lower prevalence of anxiety symptoms than younger local workers. Future recommendations should address improvements in psychological health of offshore workers in the gas and oil industries.

Associations between anxiety and their impact on postoperative pain after herniated disc surgery have been reported, but the results are inconsistent. The aim of the present longitudinal study was to evaluate the predictive value of preoperative anxiety for postoperative ongoing pain and prolonged analgesic intake after herniated disc surgery. Methods: 106 patients with lumbar disc herniation were evaluated in the study. Anxiety was measured with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7) before surgery. Pain intensity was assessed on a numeric rating scale (NRS) at baseline, 6-weeks and 6-months after surgery. Regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of pain and regular utilization of analgesics up to 6 months after surgery while controlling for confounding variables. Results: 42.5% of the patients were rated as anxiety cases (sum scores GAD-7 > 5), mean scores of anxiety showed mild to moderate symptom severity, and 43% suffered from chronic pain before surgery. Six months after surgery, 55.6% of the patients indicated pain levels of 4/10 (NRS) or higher and about 40% still took pain medication on a regular basis, regardless of their preoperative classification as anxiety-case (37.7% and 41.5%). The preoperative pain level was statistically significant for ongoing postsurgical pain in all four analyses (p < 0.001). With binary logistic regression analyses, preoperative pain intensity, but neither demographic factors nor preoperative anxiety, was identified as predictor for postoperative pain and need for analgesic medication up to 6 months after lumbar disc surgery. Conclusion: We found no evidence for the presence of anxiety before disc surgery being a prognostic factor for ongoing pain and regular postoperative intake of analgesics. Only preoperative pain intensity was predictive for increased pain and continued need for analgesic medication up to 6 months after lumbar disc surgery.Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01488617.

Additional aim was to carry out the factor analysis of symptoms reported on various scales. Methodology: 83 elderly patients (age ≥ 60 years) with depression were evaluated on GDS-30, BDI, GAD-7 and PHQ-15. Results: 60 subjects (72.28%) had GAD-7 score of ≥ 10, which is indicative of significant anxiety. On PHQ-15, 98.8% of patients had moderate to severe somatization. There was no correlation between severity of depressive symptoms (as assessed by GDS-30 and BDI) with anxiety and depressive symptoms except for significant correlation between BDI total score and GAD-7 total score (Pearson correlation coefficient-0.319;p = 0.003).Factor analysis of GDS-30 yielded a five factor solution and when the items of other 3 scales were added, the number of factors/symptoms clusters increased to 7. Conclusion: The present study suggests that there is a higher prevalence of anxiety and somatic symptoms in elderly patients with depression and GDS-30 is unable to capture all the symptoms of depression among elderly in the Indian context. Hence, complete assessment of depression in elderly should include assessment of anxiety and somatic symptoms by using other scales like GAD-7,BDI-II and PHQ-15. There is a need to develop a new scale which will be helpful in capturing the entire symptom profile of depression among elderly.

In such groups, a greater consumption of information pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic may increase anxiety. Objective: In this study, we examine the association between online activity and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) scores in the United States. Methods: We recruited participants for an online survey through advertisements on various platforms such as Google, Facebook, and Reddit. A total of 406 adult US participants with moderate to severe (≥ 10) GAD-7 scores met the inclusion criteria and completed the survey. Anxiety levels measured using the GAD-7 scale formed our primary outcome. Our key independent variables were average daily time spent online and average daily time spent online searching about COVID-19 within the past 14 days. We used as controls potential confounders of the relation between our key independent variables and GAD-7 scores, namely, sleep quality, the COVID-19 Fear Inventory scale, binge drinking, substance use, prescription drug abuse, and sociodemographic attributes. Results: Linear multivariate regression analyses showed that GAD-7 scores were higher among those who spent > 4 hours online (per day) searching for information about COVID-19 (coefficient 1.29, P = .002), controlling for all other covariates.

"Association of depression and anxiety with the 10-year risk of cardiovascular mortality in a primary care population of Latvia using the SCORE system.","Ivanovs, Rolands; Kivite, Anda; Ziedonis, Douglas; Mintale, Iveta; Vrublevska, Jelena; Rancans, Elmars","Frontiers in Psychiatry",="16640640",,="20180626","9",,,,"2018-32802-001","10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00276","Frontiers Media S.A.","Journal Article","Anxiety Disorders; Cardiovascular Disorders; Major Depression; Primary Health Care; Psychiatric Symptoms; Mortality Rate; Risk Factors; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Male; Female",,"Background: Depression and anxiety have been recognized as independent risk factors for both the development and prognosis of cardiovascular (CV) diseases (CVD). The Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) function measures the 10-year risk of a fatal CVD and is a crucial tool for guiding CV patient management. This study is the first in Latvia to investigate the association of depression and anxiety with the 10-year CV mortality risk in a primary care population. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at 24 primary care facilities. During a 1-week period in 2015, all consecutive adult patients were invited to complete a nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and a seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) followed by sociodemographic questionnaire and physical measurements. The diagnostic Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) was administered by telephone in the period of 2 weeks after the first contact at the primary care facility. A hierarchical multivariate analysis was performed. Results: The study population consisted of 1,569 subjects. Depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 ≥ 10) were associated with a 1.57 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06–2.33) times higher odds of a very high CV mortality risk (SCORE ≥ 10%), but current anxiety disorder (M.I.N.I.) reduced the CV mortality risk with an odds ratio of 0.58 (95% CI: 0.38–0.90). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that individuals with SCORE ≥ 10% should be screened and treated for depression to potentially delay the development and improve the prognosis of CVD. Anxiety could possibly have a protective influence on CV prognosis.

Therapists completed a survey including the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) and a job satisfaction scale (JDSS). Results: After controlling for case-mix, around 5% of variability in treatment outcomes was explained by therapist effects (TE). Higher therapist OLBI-disengagement and lower JDSS scores were significantly associated with poorer treatment outcomes, explaining between 31 and 39% of the TE estimate. Higher OLBI scores were also correlated with lower job satisfaction ratings.

Some research points to the possible benefits of involving concerned significant others (CSOs) in treatment. This study compared the efficacy of behavioral couples therapy (BCT) and CBT for both the gambler and the CSO. Design: Two parallel‐group randomized controlled study comparing two different internet‐based treatments for PG. Follow‐up measures were conducted at treatment finish, and at 3‐, 6‐ and 12‐month post‐treatment. Setting: Stockholm, Sweden. Participants: A total of 136 problem gamblers and 136 CSOs were included in the study: 68 gamblers and 68 CSOs for each treatment condition. The gamblers were on average 35.6 years old and 18.4% were female. CSOs were on average 45.3 years old and 75.7% were women. Interventions: A treatment based on BCT was compared with a CBT intervention. Both treatments were internet‐based, with 10 therapist‐guided self‐help modules accompanied by weekly telephone and e‐mail support from a therapist. CSOs were given treatment in the BCT condition, but not in the CBT condition. Measurements: The primary outcome measures were time‐line follow‐back for gambling (TLFB‐G) and the NORC Diagnostic Screen for Gambling Problems (NODS) for problem gamblers, corresponding to DSM‐IV criteria for pathological gambling. Secondary outcomes measures were the Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 (PHQ‐9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder seven‐item scale (GAD‐7), the Relation Assessment Scale Generic (RAS‐G), the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), the Inventory of Consequences of Gambling for the Gambler and CSO (ICS) and adherence to treatment for both the problem gambler and the CSO. Findings: The outcomes of both gambler groups improved, and differences between the groups were not statistically significant: TLFB‐G: multiplicative effect = 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.30;4.31); NODS: multiplicative effect = 0.80, 95%, 95% CI = 0.24;2.36. BCT gamblers began treatment to a higher proportion than CBT gamblers: P = 0.002. Conclusions: Differences in the efficacy of internet‐based behavioral couples therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy for treatment of problem gambling were not significant, but more gamblers commenced treatment in the behavioral couples therapy group.

Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Outpatient VA clinics. Subjects: Forty-seven community-dwelling veterans with CLBP (age 68.0 ± 6.5 years, range = 60–88 years, 12.8% female, 66% white) participated. Methods: Data were collected on peripheral pain generators—body mass index, American College of Rheumatology hip osteoarthritis criteria, neurogenic claudication (i.e., spinal stenosis), sacroiliac joint (SIJ) pain, myofascial pain, leg length discrepancy (LLD), and iliotibial band pain; and CNS pain generators—anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index), maladaptive coping (Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire, Cognitive Strategies Questionnaire), and fibromyalgia (fibromyalgia survey). Outcomes were pain severity (0 to 10 scale, seven-day average and worst), self-reported pain interference (Roland Morris [RM] questionnaire), and gait speed. Results: Approximately 96% had at least one peripheral CLBP contributor, 83% had at least one CNS contributor, and 80.9% had both peripheral and CNS contributors. Of the peripheral conditions, only SIJ pain and LLD were associated with outcomes. All of the CNS conditions and SIJ pain were related to RM score.

Blended care psychotherapy, which combines the strengths of therapist-led and internet interventions, can narrow this gap and be clinically effective and efficient, but has rarely been evaluated outside of controlled research settings. Objective: This study evaluated the effectiveness of a blended care intervention (video-based cognitive behavior therapy and internet intervention) under real-world conditions. Methods: This is a pragmatic retrospective cohort analysis of 385 participants with clinical range depression and/or anxiety symptoms at baseline, measured using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), who enrolled in blended care psychotherapy treatment. Participants resided in the United States and had access to the blended care intervention as a mental health benefit offered through their employers. Levels of depression and anxiety were tracked throughout treatment. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to examine the change in symptoms over time. The effects of age, gender, and providers on participants’ symptom change trajectories were also evaluated. Paired sample t-tests were also conducted, and rates of positive clinical change and clinically significant improvement were calculated. Results: The average depression and anxiety symptoms at 6 weeks after the start of treatment were 5.94 and 6.57, respectively. There were significant linear effects of time on both symptoms of depression and anxiety (β = –.49, P < .001 and β = –.64, P < .001). The quadratic effect was also significant for both symptoms of depression and anxiety (β = .04, P < .001 for both), suggesting a decelerated decrease in symptoms over time. Approximately 73% (n = 283) of all 385 participants demonstrated reliable improvement, and 83% (n=319) recovered on either the PHQ-9 or GAD-7 measures. Large effect sizes were observed on both symptoms of depression (Cohen d = 1.08) and of anxiety (d = 1.33). Conclusions: Video blended care cognitive behavioral therapy interventions can be effective and efficient in treating symptoms of depression and anxiety in real-world conditions. Future research should investigate the differential and interactive contribution of the therapist-led and digital components of care to patient outcomes to optimize care.

With only low-quality evidence suggesting anxiolytic effects of cannabis and strong public sentiment surrounding such purported effects, the purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of cannabis for medicinal purposes (CMP) use for anxiety symptoms. An online survey was disseminated to CMP users registered with a Canadian licensed producer. Respondents completed demographic and validated self-report questionnaires (GAD-7, PHQ-9, MINI-SPIN, and panic disorder/agoraphobia DSM-5 criteria). Cannabis use behaviors were also discussed. Overall, 2032 completed responses with a verified user number were collected. Of the total sample, 888 (43.7%) reported CMP authorization to treat anxiety symptoms and completed all psychometric screening instruments. Rates of probable disorders were high (Generalized Anxiety Disorder: 45.6%, Social Anxiety Disorder: 42.4%, Major Depressive Disorder: 25.7%, Panic Disorder/Agoraphobia: 25.7%); 63.4% met screening criteria for ≥1 disorder. Most (92%) reported that cannabis improved their symptoms, despite continuing to endorse moderate-level severity. Nearly half (49%) reported replacing a non-psychiatric (53.7%) or psychiatric medication (46.3%) prescribed to them by their physician with CMP. Respondents endorsed daily CMP use and severity of anxiety (GAD-7, p < 0.001) and depressive (PHQ-9, p < 0.001) symptoms were positively associated with the amount of cannabis used/day. The vast majority perceived symptom improvement with CMP use and did not believe CMP use was associated with impairment or an inability to control use. Nevertheless, the possibility of cannabis use disorder cannot be ruled out as well as the possibility that improvements in non-psychiatric conditions were attributed to improvements in anxiety. These results highlight the need to systematically evaluate CMP use for mental illness.

Results: The majority of participants were familial caregivers (N = 60), of which 70% experienced significant caregiver burden. In this group, 10.0% caregivers had clinically significant depression and 16.7% caregivers who had clinically significant anxiety. On multivariate analysis, factors found to be associated with caregiver burden were Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) of < 7, presence of neuropsychiatric complications, and presence of anxiety. There was also a high prevalence of caregiver burden in foreign domestic workers (29.4%). Conclusion: There is a high rate of caregiver burden in both familial caregivers and foreign domestic workers who care for patients with severe traumatic brain injury.

We aimed to investigate caregiver burden, sleep quality, and stress in caregivers of patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration and dementia with Lewy bodies, as compared with caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Methods: This study was carried out from March 2011 to January 2014. In total, 492 dyads of patient and caregiver (frontotemporal lobar degeneration, n = 131; dementia with Lewy bodies, n = 36; Alzheimer's disease, n = 325) participated in this study. We compared patients with respect to the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and caregivers with respect to the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale. Results: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration and dementia with Lewy bodies patients presented significantly more neuropsychiatric symptoms compared to Alzheimer's disease patients. Caregivers of frontotemporal lobar degeneration and dementia with Lewy bodies patients experienced significantly more burden compared to Alzheimer's disease caregivers. Furthermore, among caregivers of both frontotemporal lobar degeneration and dementia with Lewy bodies patients burden was predicted by the neuropsychiatric symptoms, PHQ-9 scores, and GAD-7 scores. Conclusions: The frequency and severity of behavioral disturbances in patient and caregiver stress accounted for the increased caregiver burden, which suggests that frontotemporal lobar degeneration and dementia with Lewy bodies caregivers should receive more support than is currently available.

Convergent evidence suggests that ketamine may be effective in targeting measures of anhedonia in adults with treatment resistant depression (TRD). Methods: This retrospective, post-hoc analysis included 203 (x̄ = 45 ± 14.6 years of age) patients receiving four infusions of intravenous (IV) ketamine at a community-based clinic. The primary outcome measure was change in anhedonia severity, as measured by the Snaith–Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS). Secondary measures sought to determine if improvement on the SHAPS mediated the effect of repeated IV ketamine infusions on symptoms of depression and suicidal ideations, as measured by the Quick Inventory for Depression Symptomatology-Self Report 16-Item (QIDS-SR16) and anxiety, as measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). Results: After adjusting for age, sex, primary diagnosis, concomitant medication, body mass index, and baseline depression severity, there was a statistically significant reduction in symptoms of anhedonia with IV ketamine treatment (F (2, 235.6) = 31.6, p < 0.001). Improvements in depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and anxiety symptoms with repeated-dose IV ketamine were significantly partially mediated by reduction in anhedonic severity. Moreover, the combination of number of infusions received and change in anhedonic severity accounted for 26% of the variance in depressive score improvements. Limitations: This is a post-hoc analysis of retrospective data and lacks a control group. Conclusion: Ketamine was effective in improving measures of anhedonia in this large, well-characterized community-based sample of adults with TRD. Improvements in anhedonia also partially mediated the significant improvement in depressive symptoms, suicidality, and anxiety.

Emerging research has suggested that treating a substance use disorder simultaneously with tobacco use leads to a higher rate of treatment success for both substances. Despite this, substance use treatment protocols tend not to focus on tobacco use; in fact, traditional substance use treatments often discourage patients from attempting to quit smoking. One rationale is that patients may not be motivated to quit smoking. In the current study, data from veterans enrolled in outpatient treatment for a SUD were examined to assess for general characteristics of smokers as compared to non-smokers as well as to examine motivation to quit smoking. Baseline (i.e., pre-treatment) data from 277 Veterans were used. Charts of smokers in the SUD clinic (SUDC) were reviewed to assess how smoking is handled by SUDC providers, and if smokers attempt cessation. Of 277, 163 (59%) SUDC patients reported that they currently smoke cigarettes (M = 16.3 cigarettes per day, SD = 11.1). Smokers in the clinic reported greater general impairment than nonsmokers on the Short Index of Problems, F(1248) = 8.9, p = 0.003, as well as greater specific impairment: Physical Problems, F(1258) = 13.5, p = 0.000; Interpersonal Problems, F(1262) = 5.6, p = 0.019; Intrapersonal Problems, F(1260) = 6.5, p = 0.011, and Social Responsibility, F(1262) = 14.7, p = 0.000. Smokers in the sample were marginally more anxious than their non-smoking counterparts as measured by the GAD-7, F(1254) = 4.6, p = 0.053, though they were not significantly more depressed (p = 0.19). On a 1–10 scale, smokers reported moderate levels of importance (M = 5.4, SD = 3.1), readiness (M = 5.6, SD = 3.2), and confidence (M = 5.0, SD = 3.0) regarding quitting smoking. Review of smokers' medical records reveal that while SUDC providers assess tobacco use at intake (90%) and offer treatment (86.5%), a substantially small portion of smokers attempt cessation (41.1%) while enrolled in SUDC. Moreover, no patients were enrolled in smoking-specific behavioral interventions while in SUDC, though 78 patients did obtain nicotine replacement or another smoking cessation medication (41% were prescribed by a SUDC provider). Contrary to the belief that treatment-seeking substance users are not motivated to quit smoking, these preliminary analyses demonstrate that Veterans were at least contemplating quitting smoking while they were enrolled in substance use treatment. Further, there is evidence that cigarette smokers have greater impairment caused by substance use, suggesting that this subgroup is of particular high need. Specific treatment recommendations are discussed, including how behavioral health providers in SUD clinics may be better able to capitalize on patients' moderate motivation to quit at intake.

The aim of the current study was to demonstrate its clinical and cost effectiveness during and after CES in people with generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) who had not responded to low intensity psychological treatment in a routine health service. Methods: Consecutive sample of eligible patients with GAD waiting for individual cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) selected from two publicly funded services in England. They received 60 min per day Alpha-Stim CES for 6–12 weeks. Primary outcome was remission on the GAD-7 scale at 12 and 24 weeks. Cost effectiveness was examined using a cost minimisation model of direct health costs. Results: Of 161 patients recruited, 72 (44.7%) and 77 (47.8%) achieved remission on the GAD-7 at 12 and 24 weeks respectively with 122 (75.8%) receiving at least 6 weeks CES. Mean (sd) GAD-7 score at baseline significantly improved from 15.77 (3.21) to 8.92 (5.42) and 8.99 (6.18) at 12 and 24 weeks respectively (p < 0.001). 80 (49.7%) participants required further individual CBT. CES provided a saving of £540.88 per patient (95% CI −£327.12, £648.69). Limitations: Participants were not randomised and there was no control group. Only 48 (29.9%) participants completed every assessment. Conclusion: In patients with generalised anxiety disorder not responding to low intensity psychological treatment, 6–12 weeks daily Alpha Stim CES may be effective after treatment and 3 months later, thereby reducing the need for individual CBT and saving health costs.

Clinical characteristics, psychosomatic features, and quality of life (QOL) were compared among these groups. Results: A total of 312 migraine patients participated in the study. Among them, 58 (18.6%), 202 (64.7%), and 52 (16.7%) were allocated to groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Chronic migraine, family history of migraine, medication overuse headache, earlier age at onset, longer disease duration, higher headache intensity, and aggravation with physical activity were more prevalent in group 1 than in groups 2 or 3. Scores of the MIDAS, HIT-6, PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI, and FSS were the highest in group 1, followed by groups 2 and group 3. The lowest QOL was noted in group 1, followed by groups 2 and group 3. Conclusions: This study revealed that SH in migraine, particularly combined with allodynia, may result in poor clinical outcomes.

Primary care is the de facto site for treating these mental health problems but is typically underresourced to meet the burden of these demands. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of a mobile intervention platform, IntelliCare, for addressing depression and anxiety among primary care patients. Design, Setting, and Participants: Two-arm randomized clinical trial at internal medicine clinics at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Adult primary care patients (N = 146) who screened positive for depression on the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ; score ≥ 10) or anxiety on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7; score ≥ 8) were recruited between July 17, 2018, and December 14, 2018. Interventions: The coach-supported platform composed of a suite of apps, was delivered over 8 weeks.Wait list control participants received treatment as usual for 8 weeks, then the mobile platform. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomeswere changes in depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) during the intervention period. Secondary outcomes were differences in the proportion of patients who achieved recovery (PHQ-9/GAD-7 < 5 or 50% improvement from baseline), sustainment of intervention effects during 2-month follow-up, and app use during the intervention period. Results: One hundred forty-six patients were included (119 of 146 were women [81.5%]; mean [SD] age, 42.3 [13.8] years). Of the 146 patients, 122 (83.6%) were diagnosed as having depression and 131 (89.7%) were diagnosed as having anxiety. A greater proportion of intervention vs wait list control participants achieved recovery from depression (n = 38 of 64 [59%] vs n = 18 of 58 [31%]; odds ratio, 3.25; 95%CI, 1.54-6.86) and anxiety (n = 37 of 65 [57%] vs n = 25 of 66 [38%]; odds ratio, 2.17; 95%CI, 1.08-4.36). Sustained effects were observed for depression (slope, 0.01; 95%CI, –0.09 to 0.10; P = .92) and anxiety scores (slope, 0.02; 95%CI, –0.08 to 0.12; P = .67) during follow-up. App use was high, with a median of 93 and 98 sessions among participants with depression and anxiety, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: In this trial, a mobile intervention app was effective for depression and anxiety among primary care patients. Findings also support designing digital mental health interventions as platforms containing simple, brief apps that can be bundled by users to meet their needs.

However, they are typically treated separately and there is a dearth of information on tackling them together. Aims: The study's purpose was to establish how best to treat co-occurring anxiety and depression in a routine clinical service-specifically, to compare cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) focusing only on depression (CBT-D) to a broader CBT focusing on both depression and anxiety (CBT-DA). Method: Case notes of 69 patients with equally severe clinical levels of depression and anxiety seen in a routine clinical service were randomly selected to review from a pool of 990 patients. The mean age was 44.61 years (SD = 12.97). 65% of the sample were female and 88% reported their ethnicity white. The content of electronic records reporting techniques used and scores on a measure of depression (The Patient Health Questionnaire) and anxiety (The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment) were reviewed to categorise therapy as CBT-D or CBT-DA. Results: Results indicated significant overall improvement with CBT; 70% and 77% of the sample met criteria for reliable improvement on The Patient Health Questionnaire and The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment respectively. Fewer patients who received CBT-DA met The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment recovery criteria at the end of treatment than those who received CBT-D. Mean post treatment PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores remained above threshold for those receiving CBT_DA but not those receiving CBT-D. There was no evidence suggesting CBT-DA was superior to CBT-D. Conclusions: In patients with equally severe clinical levels of depression and anxiety, a broader treatment addressing both anxiety and depression does not appear to be associated with improved outcomes compared to treatment focused on depression.

Methods: Acutely depressed subjects with recurrent MDD (n = 100) and age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls (HC; n = 100) between the ages of 18 and 65 completed the cross-sectional validation study of the THINC-integrated tool (THINC-it; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02508493). Objective cognitive performance was assessed using the THINC-it, and subjective cognitive impairment with the Perceived Deficits Questionnaire for Depression–5-item. Subjects also completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7-item (GAD-7) questionnaire. Results: Subjects with MDD reported significantly more anxiety symptoms, as assessed by the GAD-7, compared to HC (p < 0.001). Linear regression analysis determined that anxiety symptoms significantly accounted for 70.4% of the variability in subjective cognitive impairment, adjusting for depression severity. Moreover, subjects’ ratings of the difficulties caused by their anxiety were reported as significantly more severe among subjects with MDD when compared to HC (p < 0.001). Likewise, greater self-reported difficulties with anxiety significantly predicted 57.8% of the variability in subjective cognitive impairment, adjusting for depression severity. Neither anxiety symptoms nor impairment due to anxiety symptoms predicted objective cognitive performance. Limitations: Subjects were not prospectively verified to have a clinical diagnosis of GAD. Rather, this study examined the relationships between symptoms of generalized anxiety, assessed using a brief screening tool, and subjective and objective cognitive function. Conclusions: Results from the current study indicate that adults with MDD and high levels of self-reported anxiety are significantly more likely to report experiencing subjective cognitive dysfunction.

Using a learned helplessness framework, the current study examined the extent to which discrimination, immigration legal status difficulties, and adverse childhood experiences moderated the effects of harsh working conditions on depression and anxiety. The study also examined the extent to which harsh working conditions mediated the effects of discrimination, immigration legal status difficulties, and adverse childhood experiences on depression and anxiety. Participants were 241 migrant farmworkers recruited in the Midwest. Participants completed interviews consisting of the Migrant Farmworker Stress Index (MFWSI), Adverse Childhood Events Scale (ACEs), Everyday Discrimination Scale, the Centers for Epidemiology Scale for Depression (CES-D), and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Tests of indirect effects suggested, working conditions mediated the effects of ACEs, immigration legal status fears, and discrimination on CES-D and GAD-7 scores (p values < .05). Higher ACEs and discrimination also appeared to be associated with larger effects of harsh working conditions on depression and anxiety (p values < .05), while legal status fears did not significantly moderate the effect of harsh working conditions on either outcome (p values > .05). Likely through different mechanisms, adverse childhood experiences, discrimination and immigration legal status are associated with higher risk of harsh working conditions and subsequently these conditions account for much of the relations between these 3 stressors with depression and anxiety. Additionally, discrimination and adverse childhood experiences appear to then enhance the effects of working conditions.

The Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme has increased the reach of psychological treatments to people with common mental disorders in England. However, psychotic experiences are neither measured nor considered in therapy. We aimed to confirm the presence of psychotic experiences among IAPT service‐users and determine whether these experiences are associated with higher depression/anxiety levels and poorer recovery. All service‐users that attended the Fenland and Peterborough IAPT teams in Cambridgeshire between November 16, 2015 and January 29, 2016 participated in a service evaluation. In addition to routine mesures, such as the Generalized Anxiety Disorder‐7 questionnaire (GAD‐7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 (PHQ‐9), we introduced a shortened version of the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE‐P15) to measure psychotic experiences. Classes of individuals were identified with latent class analysis. Associations were reported using Pearson correlation coefficient. One hundred and seventy‐three services‐users were included, mostly females (N = 133; 76.9%). The mean age was 36.6 (SD = 13.3). Around 30% likely belonged to a class with psychotic experiences. CAPE‐P15 frequency was significantly correlated to PHQ‐9 (r = 0.44; P < .001) and GAD‐7 (r = 0.32; P < .001). Similarly, CAPE‐P15 distress and both PHQ‐9 (r = 0.43; P < .001) and GAD‐7 (r = 0.38; P < .001) were highly correlated. These associations were replicated after the initial period of the therapy, indicating poor recovery. Some IAPT service‐users suffer psychotic experiences. Tailoring available evidence‐based psychological therapies for these people in IAPT settings might trailblaze a new care pathway to improve recovery in this group.

The present study aimed to investigate frequencies of ICD-10 somatoform disorders and DSM-5 somatic symptom disorders, and how the respective diagnostic groups differ in terms of sociodemographic and psychopathological characteristics. It discusses the usefulness and reliability of the new diagnostic criteria. Method: Patients from a German psychosomatic outpatient clinic (n = 438) completed self-report questionnaires on depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), symptom burden (PHQ-15), psychological distress (SSD-12), and quality of life (SF-12). ICD-10 diagnoses were provided by treating clinicians, DSM-5 diagnoses were assessed via semi-structured telephone interviews. The prevalence of somatic symptom disorders and their overlap with ICD-10 somatoform disorders was evaluated. Comparisons between patients with either diagnosis were drawn. Results: More than half of the sample (n = 239, 54.6%) fulfilled the criteria for a somatic symptom disorder. Compared to patients fulfilling ICD-10 criteria only, patients with a somatic symptom disorder presented higher levels of symptom related distress (p = .045), health related anxiety (p = .004), general anxiety (p = .011), and lower mental health-related quality of life (p = .015), while patients with ICD-10 somatoform disorders reported a lower physical health-related quality of life (p = .031). Conclusion: DSM-5 criteria included more patients than ICD-10 somatoform disorders in our sample. Patients diagnosed with a somatic symptom disorder appear to be more severely impaired in terms of general and health-related anxiety and psychological distress associated to their somatic symptoms, especially when diagnosed with a severe form of somatic symptom disorder.

Objective: This study aimed to examine the effect of 2 methods of maintaining engagement with the IntelliCare platform, coaching, and receipt of weekly recommendations to try different apps on depression, anxiety, and app use. Methods: A total of 301 participants with depression or anxiety were randomized to 1 of 4 treatments lasting 8 weeks and were followed for 6 months posttreatment. The trial used a 2X2 factorial design (coached vs self-guided treatment and weekly app recommendations vs no recommendations) to compare engagement metrics. Results: The median time to last use of any app during treatment was 56 days (interquartile range 54-57), with 253 participants (84.0%, 253/301) continuing to use the apps over a median of 92 days posttreatment. Receipt of weekly recommendations resulted in a significantly higher number of app use sessions during treatment (overall median = 216; P = .04) but only marginal effects for time to last use (P = .06) and number of app downloads (P = .08). Coaching resulted in significantly more app downloads (P < .001), but there were no significant effects for time to last download or number of app sessions (P = .36) or time to last download (P = .08). Participants showed significant reductions in the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) across all treatment arms (Ps < .001). Coached treatment led to larger GAD-7 reductions than those observed for self-guided treatment (P = .03), but the effects for the PHQ-9 did not reach significance (P = .06).

Although psychological interventions have been developed for seizure disorders, few patients can currently access them. We aimed to assess the acceptability and feasibility of a self-help intervention targeting stress in patients with seizures, and to provide preliminary evidence for its effectiveness. Method: Patients were recruited from outpatient neurology clinics and randomized to an immediate intervention group (n = 39), who received the intervention at baseline, or a delayed intervention group (n = 43), who received the intervention one-month postbaseline. Participants completed self-report questionnaires measuring stress (Smith Stress Symptom Inventory [SSSI]), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale [GAD-7]), depression (Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy [NDDI-E]), quality of life (European Quality of Life—5 Dimensions [EQ-5D]), and seizure severity and frequency (Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale [LSSS-3]) at baseline, and at one- and two-month follow-up. Participants also provided telephone feedback. The intervention consisted of a self-help stress management workbook based on an integrative stress model framework. Results: Although the rate of participants failing to return follow-up information at two months was approximately 50%, those who completed the trial found the intervention acceptable; with the majority rating it as helpful (63.6%) and that they would recommend it to others with seizures (88.1%). A significant reduction in self-reported stress (P = .01) with a medium effect size (dz = 0.51) was observed one-month postintervention. There were no significant changes in any other measures. Conclusion: The intervention was perceived to be acceptable, safe, and helpful by participants. It could be a useful complementary treatment option for reducing stress experienced by patients living with seizure disorders. Further evaluation in a larger trial is warranted.

In the current study we compared symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety as well as general health status in the four BMI-classes: underweight, normal weight, overweight and obesity. Furthermore, mediator role of general health status on the relationship between BMI and depression and generalized anxiety was analyzed. Methods: A representative sample (random-route sampling) of the German population (N = 2350) was investigated in a cross-sectional survey by measuring the three questionnaires PHQ-9, GAD-7 and EQ-5D-5L. Results: The results showed significant differences between the four BMI-classes in all three questionnaires. Individuals with obesity demonstrated higher values in depression, anxiety and general health compared to the three other BMI-classes. However, there was no U-shaped association between BMI and depression, anxiety and health-related quality of life. Regarding to the mediation analysis, general health status fully mediated the association between BMI, depressive symptoms as well as generalized anxiety symptoms. Limitations: The assessment of the three factors depression, anxiety and general health status were measured by questionnaires, but no clinical diagnoses can be provided. Conclusions: Evidence supports that individuals with obesity have an increased risk for depression and anxiety as well as lower general health. Further research on potential intervention and strategies in public health policies is needed to be able to target the developing of mental disorders in individuals with obesity. Taking their general health status into account is also of great importance.

The aim of the current report was to explore whether the effectiveness of CES was related to its effects on depression or anxiety over time Methods: A consecutive sample of 161 eligible patients with GAD was recruited from two publicly funded services in England while they waited for individual cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) after failing to achieve remission on the GAD-7 with computerised CBT. They received 60 minutes per day Alpha-Stim CES for 6-12 weeks. Outcomes were changes in PHQ-9, GAD-7 score from baseline to 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 weeks. Latent variable cross-lagged panel analysis permitted an analysis of the differential effects of anxiety and depression with CES treatment over time. Results: Anxiety at baseline significantly predicted depression at week 4 (standardized regression weight = .40, p < 0.001). Depression at week 12 significantly predicted anxiety at week 24 (standardized regression weight = .28, p < 0.05).

Doctors recommending or referring their patients to psycho-oncologists in the course of routine consultations can positively influence psycho-oncological care. The aim of this study was to analyze the frequency and predictors of such recommendations and to examine the use of these services by patients. Methods: 4,020 cancer patients (mean age 58 years; 51% women) were evaluated in a multicenter, cross-sectional study in Germany. Data was gathered about doctors' referral practices, patients' utilization of psycho-oncological care services, and disease-related symptoms. The PHQ-9 depression scale and the GAD-7 anxiety scale were used to measure psychological burden. Descriptive data analysis was conducted on the basis of subgroup comparisons and multivariable analysis was done using binary logistical regression. Results: 21.9% of the respondents reported having been given a recommendation or referral for psycho- oncological care by a doctor within the course of their cancer diagnosis and treatment. This comprises 29.5% of the patients identified by screening as being psychologically burdened. Nearly half of the patients who received a recommendation or referral (49.8%) acted on it. Predictors for seeking out psycho-oncological care included: patient desire (OR = 2.0), previous experience with psycho-oncological care (OR = 1.59), and female gender (OR = 1.57). Multivariable analysis indicated that patients' level of psychological burden (depression, anxiety) had no effect on whether doctors gave them a recommendation or referral. Conclusions: Along with examining the degree to which patients are burdened (e.g. using screening instruments), determining whether or not patients would like to receive psycho-oncological care is an important aspect of improving referral practices and, by extension, will allow important progress in the field of psycho-oncological care to be made.

Aim: This study aimed to examine the dose‐response effect in low (LiCBT) and high (HiCBT) intensity CBT delivered in stepped care services. Methods: A multi‐service data set included N = 102 206 patients across N = 16 services. The study included patients with case‐level depression and/or anxiety symptoms who accessed LiCBT and/or HiCBT. Patients with posttreatment reliable and clinically significant improvement in standardized outcome measures (PHQ‐9, GAD‐7) were classified as treatment responders. Survival analyses assessed the number of sessions necessary to detect 50%, 75%, and 95% of treatment responders. The 50% and 95% percentiles were used to define the lower and upper boundaries of an adequate dose of therapy that could be used to inform the timing of treatment progress reviews. Analyses were then stratified by diagnosis, and cox regression was used to identify predictors of time‐to‐remission. Results: Most responders (95%) attained RCSI within 7 sessions of LiCBT and 14 sessions of HiCBT. Patients with social anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and obsessive‐compulsive disorder required HiCBT and lengthier treatments (6–16 sessions) to maximize improvement. Conclusions: Distinctive dose‐response patterns are evident for LiCBT and HiCBT, which can be used to support treatment planning and routine outcome monitoring.

Methods: The Chronic Migraine OnabotulinuMtoxinA Prolonged Efficacy open-Label (COMPEL) study is a multicentre, open-label, prospective study assessing the long-term safety and efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA 155 U over nine treatments (108 weeks) in adults with CM. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scales were used to assess the effects of onabotulinumtoxinA on comorbid symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively. A clinically meaningful improvement was assessed by the percentage of patients experiencing a ≥1 severity category reduction in PHQ-9 and GAD-7. The effects of onabotulinumtoxinA on associated sleep quality and fatigue were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Fatigue Severity Scale, respectively. Results: OnabotulinumtoxinA treatment was associated with sustained reduction in headache days and PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores in the analysis population (n = 715) over 108 weeks. PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores were significantly reduced at all time points in patients with clinically significant symptoms of depression and/or anxiety at baseline. By week 108, 78.0% and 81.5% had clinically meaningful improvement in depression and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Sleep quality and symptoms of fatigue also improved; however, less is understood about clinically meaningful changes in these measures. No new safety concerns were identified.

There are a few studies that focus on women with this condition in Ethiopia. Hence, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of surgical repair of obstetric fistula on the severity of depression and anxiety in women with obstetric fistula in Ethiopia. Method: The study employed a longitudinal study design to investigate the changes in 219 women with obstetric fistula admitted to six fistula management hospitals in Ethiopia. The data were collected on admission of the patients for obstetric fistula surgical repair and at the end of six-month post repair. A structured questionnaire was used to obtain socio-demographic information and medical history of the respondents. Depression and anxiety symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scales. The data was entered using Epi-Data software and then exported to SPSS for further analysis. The Mann-Whitney-U test, the Kruskal-Wallis test and Paired t-test were performed to measure the change in psychological symptoms after surgical repair. Result: Though 219 respondents were interviewed pre-obstetric fistula surgical repair, only 200 completed their follow up. On admission, the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms were 91 and 79% respectively. After surgical repair, the prevalence rate was 27 and 26%. The differences in the prevalence of screen-positive women were statistically significant (P < 0.001). Conclusion: The study concluded that the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms decrease post-obstetric fistula surgical repair. However, a woman with continued leaking after surgery seems to have higher psychological distress than those who are fully cured. Clinicians should manage women with obstetric fistula through targeted and integrated mental health interventions to address their mental health needs.

Excessive use leads to Technology addiction, which often start early in adolescence. The purpose of the present study was to assess Technology addiction and its correlates among school students in rural India. Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted among 885 school students in north India. Four schools were selected and participants aged 13–18 years, were enrolled randomly. A self-designed 45 item questionnaire was used to evaluate dependence syndrome (intense desire, impaired control, tolerance, withdrawal, persistence despite harm, neglect of alternate pleasure) as used for substance dependence in ICD-10. Screening for depression and anxiety was done by using patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) and generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7) respectively. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were done. Results: The mean age of the study participants was 15.1 years. Among the participants, 30.3% (95% Confidence Interval = 27.2%–33.3%) met the dependence criteria. One-third (33%) of the students stated that their grades had gone down due to gadget use. Technology addiction was more among male students (odds ratio = 2.82, 95% CI = 1.43, 5.59), those having a personal mobile phone (2.98, (1.52–5.83), use smart phone (2.77, 1.46–5.26), use one additional gadget (2.12, 1.14–3.94) and those who were depressed (3.64, 2.04–6.49). Conclusion: Increased mobile phone access in rural India is leading to technology addiction among school students. Certain demographic and gadget specific factors predict addiction. The technology addiction possibly contributes to poor academic performance and depression. This warrants studies on a larger scale, with interventions for judicious use of gadgets.

The Aldenkamp–Baker Neuropsychological Assessment Schedule (ABNAS) is a patient-reported scale validated to measure adverse cognitive effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The goals of this study were to identify predictors of patient-reported cognitive dysfunction and to assess the relationship between subjective and objective cognitive impairment. Methods: The Cleveland Clinic Knowledge Program Data Registry was used to identify adult patients seen in outpatient epilepsy clinic from January to May 2015 and who completed the following scales: ABNAS for subjective cognitive impairment, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, Quality of Life in Epilepsy (QOLIE-10), and EuroQOL five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) for health-related quality of life. Topiramate (TPM) was considered a high-risk medication for cognitive impairment. Patients were categorized into groups based on total ABNAS score: subjective cognitive impairment (ABNAS > 15; N = 270) and no subjective cognitive impairment (ABNAS ≤ 15; N = 400). Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to identify independent predictors of subjective cognitive impairment. In a subset of patients who had neuropsychological testing within 6months of completing the ABNAS (N = 60), Pearson correlations and multivariable logistic regression models, controlling for number of AEDs, depression, and anxiety, assessed the relationship between subjective cognitive impairment and objective cognitive performance on measures of intelligence, attention/working memory, verbal fluency, naming, processing speed, manual dexterity, visuomotor processing, and verbal memory. Results: Forty percent of patients in the overall sample (N = 270/670) reported cognitive impairment. The variables most strongly associated with subjective cognitive impairment were PHQ-9 score, number of AEDs, and seizure frequency. In the subset of patients with neuropsychological testing, ABNAS score was correlated with anxiety (r = 0.44), depression (r = 0.38), and attention/working memory (r = −0.31). After adjusting for depression and anxiety, patients who endorsed subjective cognitive impairment scored significantly lower on measures of nonverbal intelligence and attention/working memory, but not on other cognitive measures. Conclusions: Subjective cognitive impairment as reported on the ABNAS is most strongly associated with depressive symptomatology, number of AEDs, and seizure frequency, but not with most objective cognitive measures. Identifying these three predictors provides a clear framework to understand and address subjective cognitive complaints in adult patients with epilepsy.

Translating existing programs and using a minimally monitored model of delivery may facilitate its dissemination across countries. Aims: This randomized control trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of an iCBT transdiagnostic program translated from English to French and offered in Canada using a minimally monitored delivery model for the treatment of anxiety and depression. Method: Sixty-three French speakers recruited in Canada were randomized to iCBT or a waiting-list. A French translation of an established program, the Wellbeing Course, was offered over 8 weeks using a minimally monitored delivery model. Primary outcome measures were the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), which were obtained pre-treatment, post-treatment and at 3-month follow-up. Results: Mixed-effects models revealed that participants in the treatment group had significantly lower PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores post-treatment than controls with small between-groups effect sizes (d = 0.34 and 0.37, respectively). Within-group effect sizes on primary outcome measures were larger in the treatment than control group. Clinical recovery rates on the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were significantly higher among the treatment group (40 and 56%, respectively) than the controls (13 and 16%, respectively). Conclusions: The provision of a translated iCBT program using a minimally monitored delivery model may improve patients’ access to treatment of anxiety and depression across countries. This may be an optimal first step in improving access to iCBT before sufficient resources can be secured to implement a wider range of iCBT services.

This study assessed the feasibility of a French and self-guided version of an existing English iCBT course, called the Wellbeing Course, for the treatment of anxiety and depression. Existing ICBT programs have not yet been delivered in French, although this language is spoken worldwide. Thirty-one participants were included in a single group pre-post open trial with a 3-month follow-up. Feasibility outcomes were attrition, treatment adherence, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy. Primary outcome measures were the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9) and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7). Nearly 75% of the participants completed the program. Over 80% of the participants provided posttreatment and follow-up data. All study completers reported that they would recommend the Wellbeing Course to a friend having similar problems. Significant reductions in symptoms of anxiety and depression were found following treatment, consistent with earlier studies. These preliminary findings support the use of the assessed strategies to facilitate the cross-cultural dissemination of iCBT for a more universal access to quality psychological care.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association of sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological variables to FoP in Chinese cancer patients. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, six hundred and thirty-six cancer patients were recruited. All participants were asked to complete a personal information sheet, the Chinese version of Fear of Progression Questionnaire-Short Form (FoP-Q-SF), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and General Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7).

Methods: We present data obtained from 1,002 cancer survivors (53% male, mean age = 68 years, 26% prostate cancer, 22% breast cancer) across all cancer types 5 (N = 660) and 10 (N = 342) years after diagnosis, who were recruited via a large Clinical Cancer Registry in Germany in a cross‐sectional study. FoR, depression, and anxiety were measured using validated self‐report questionnaires (12‐item short version of the Fear of Progression Questionnaire [FoP‐Q‐SF], Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 [PHQ‐9[, and General Anxiety Disorder‐7 [GAD‐7]). Hierarchical regression models were carried out with FoR as dependent variable and time since diagnosis as control variable. Results: We found high FoR‐values in 17% of the cancer survivors (FoP‐Q‐SF total score>33). FoR was higher in the 5‐year cohort (P = .028, d = 0.153). Cancer survivors were most worried about the future of the family; they report being nervous prior to doctor's appointment and being afraid of relying on strangers help. Higher FoR was related to female gender (Beta = .149, P < .001), younger age (Beta=‐.103, P < .001), low social (Beta = ‐.129, P < .001) and emotional functioning (Beta = ‐.269, P < .001), received hormone therapy (P = .025, d = 0.056), and high anxiety levels (Beta=.227, P < .001). Conclusions: Even though FoR declines slightly over time, it is still a common mental health problem for long‐term survivors even 10 years after cancer diagnosis. Since FoR is associated with reduced emotional and social quality of life, patients who are at greater risk of experiencing FoR must be identified and supported. Particularly at risk are younger women who received hormone therapy.

Many breastfeeding mothers are reticent to increase their dose or consider additional medication, despite incomplete response, due to potential adverse effects on their newborn. These mothers are amenable to non-pharmacological intervention for complete symptom remission. The current study evaluated the feasibility of an eight-week mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) intervention as an adjunctive treatment for postpartum depression and anxiety. Methods: Women were recruited at an outpatient reproductive mental health clinic based at a maternity hospital. Participants had a diagnosis of postpartum depression/anxiety within the first year following childbirth. They were enrolled in either the MBCT intervention group (n = 14) or the treatment-as-usual control group (n = 16), and completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire, and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) at baseline and at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 3 months following baseline. Results: Multivariate analyses demonstrated that depression and anxiety levels decreased, and mindfulness levels increased, in the MBCT group, but not in the control group. Many of the between-group and over time comparisons displayed trends towards significance, although these differences were not always statistically significant. Additionally, the effect sizes for anxiety, depression, and mindfulness were frequently large, indicating that the MBCT intervention may have had a clinically significant effect on participants. Limitations: Limitations include small sample size and the non-equivalent control group design. Conclusions: We demonstrated that MBCT has potential as an adjunctive, non-pharmacological treatment for postpartum depression/anxiety that does not wholly remit with pharmacotherapy.

In the original article, in figure 2, the p values should not have been reported and have been replaced with d values and associated 95% CIs.] Background: Previous research suggests that the use of outcome feedback technology can enable psychological therapists to identify and resolve obstacles to clinical improvement. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of an outcome feedback quality assurance system applied in stepped care psychological services. Methods: This multisite, open-label, cluster randomised controlled trial was done at eight National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in England, involving therapists who were qualified to deliver evidence-based low-intensity or high-intensity psychological interventions. Adult patients (18 years or older) who accessed individual therapy with participating therapists were eligible for inclusion, except patients who accessed group therapies and those who attended less than two individual therapy sessions. Therapists were randomly assigned (1:1) to an outcome feedback intervention group or a treatment-as-usual control group by use of a computer-generated randomisation algorithm. The allocation of patients to therapists was quasi-random, whereby patients on waiting lists were allocated sequentially on the basis of therapist availability. All patients received low-intensity (less than eight sessions) or high-intensity (up to 20 sessions) psychological therapies for the duration of the 1-year study period. An automated computer algorithm alerted therapists in the outcome feedback group to patients who were not on track, and primed them to review these patients in clinical supervision. The primary outcome was symptom severity on validated depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) and anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 [GAD-7]) measures after treatment of varying durations, which were compared between groups with multilevel modelling, controlling for cluster (therapist) effects. We used an intention-to-treat approach. This trial was prospectively registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN12459454. Findings: In total, 79 therapists were recruited to the study between Jan 8, 2016, and July 15, 2016, but two did not participate. Of these participants, 39 (51%) were randomly assigned to the outcome feedback group and 38 (49%) to the control group. Overall, 2233 patients were included in the trial (1176 [53%] were treated by therapists in the outcome feedback group, and 1057 [47%] by therapists in the control group). Patients classified as not on track had less severe symptoms after treatment if they were allocated to the outcome feedback group than those in the control group (PHQ-9 d = 0·23, B = –1·03 [95% CI −1·84 to −0·23], p = 0·012; GAD-7 d = 0·19, B = –0·85 [–1·56 to −0·14], p = 0·019). Interpretation: Supplementing psychological therapy with low-cost feedback technology can reduce symptom severity in patients at risk of poor response to treatment. This evidence supports the implementation of outcome feedback in stepped care psychological services.

A cross-sectional study was conducted for which questionnaire was designed along the standard scoring scales of depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7) and phobia (IAPT) completed by 300 enrolled students. Females (52%) of the medical institute suffered from mild to moderately-severe depression in contrast to the males (33%). Females were found to be affected by mild anxiety and phobia (42.7 and 26% respectively) exceeding the male population (27.3 and 15.3% respectively). However, severe depression or anxiety was not observed in either gender groups significantly, suggesting a healthy mental picture of these medical students. It can be concluded that health care students in modern upgraded education systems, in contrast to evidence from literature, have been able to adopt better coping mechanisms for maintaining their mental health.

It comprises a highly structured seminar for couples and babies, usual primary care from a WWWT-trained nurse and take-home print materials. The aim was to assess long-term outcomes after a cluster randomised controlled trial of WWWT. Method: Trial participants who consented completed a computer-assisted telephone interview 18 months postpartum. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and anxiety symptoms with the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Impacts of baseline characteristics and trial arm on changes in scores from baseline to follow-up were calculated using Conditional Latent Growth Curve Models adjusting for prognostic indicators and controlling for clustering effects. Results: Overall, 314/400 (78.5%) women contributed data at baseline (6 weeks postpartum), trial endline (26 weeks postpartum) and follow-up (12 months after trial endline). In intention-to-treat analyses, there was a significantly greater improvement in adjusted GAD-7 scores [regression coefficient (RC) −0.55; 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.94 to −0.17] and non-significant improvement (RC −0.27; 95% CI −0.63 to 0.08) in PHQ-9 scores from baseline to follow-up in the intervention than the control arm. In a per-protocol analysis, the proportion with GAD-7 scores ≥ 4 (asymptomatic) improved 24.1% (55.7% baseline to 79.8% follow-up, p = 0.043) among women who received the full WWWT programme, which included the seminar, compared with 2.4% (77.1–79.5%, p = 0.706) among those who received the partial intervention (usual care from WWWT-trained nurse and print materials). Conclusions: The WWWT programme has a significant sustained beneficial impact on postnatal generalised anxiety among primiparous women compared with usual care. The in-person seminar is the most influential component of the intervention. Psycho-educational programmes integrated into primary care appear promising as a strategy to reduce postpartum common mental disorders.

In comparison with men, older women experience higher levels of anxiety and show different patterns of co-occurring mental disorders. The aim of this study is to investigate gender-specific biopsychosocial predictors associated with GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) symptoms after a period of three years in the elderly population. Methods: Data were derived from the third (2008–2010) and the fourth follow-up (2011–2014) of the large population-based German ESTHER study. 2254 participants ages 55–85 were included in the study (52.3% female; 47.7% male). Generalized Anxiety Disorder Symptoms were measured using the GAD-7 questionnaire at both follow-ups. Linear regression analyses were performed to predict GAD severity after three years; the analyses were separated by gender and adjusted for demographic variables, biopsychosocial health, cognitive impairment, loneliness, and psychosocial resources. Results: In women, GAD severity after three years (t1) was positively associated with younger age, depression symptoms, loneliness, and GAD severity at t0. In men, GAD severity was positively associated with somatic symptoms as well as with GAD severity at t0. In both genders GAD severity at baseline was the strongest predictor of elevated future anxiety symptoms. Limitations: GAD was examined by the use of questionnaires rather than by personal assessment; underreporting of GAD symptoms is therefore possible. Conclusions: Our study shows that an increase as well as a decrease of GAD severity in older women and men can be predicted by several biopsychosocial variables.

Recently, grit, defined as perseverance and passion for long-term goals, has emerged as an indicator of success and well-being. However, the relationship between grit and poor mental health outcomes among university students is largely unknown. The current study investigates the relationship of grit with depression and anxiety among university students in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from January to March 2018 among university students aged 18–24 years from Chiang Mai University, the first largest university in Chiang Mai Province. Depression and anxiety were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) Scales, respectively. Grit was measured using the 8-item Short Grit Scale (GRIT-S). Grit scores were grouped into three categories: low (below the 25th percentile); average (from the 25th to the 75th percentiles); and high (above the 75th percentile). The other covariates included variables such self-esteem and socio-demographic variables. Results: Of the 800 participants included in the study, 405 (50.6%) were female and 395 (49.4%) were male. Respectively 21.4% and 7.8% of the participants had depression and clinical symptoms of GAD. Increasing levels of grit negatively correlated with PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores. Participants with high level of grit scored respectively 1.69 points (P < 0.001) and 1.71 points (P < 0.001) lower on the PHQ-9 scale and GAD-7 scores. Similarly, self-esteem was negatively associated with PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the negative correlation of grit with poor mental health outcomes, particularly depression and anxiety. Interventions designed to improve grit could play an essential role in the prevention of adverse mental health outcomes among university students.

However, it remains poorly understood whether routine screening in CVD populations identifies the broader groups of disorders that cluster together within individuals, known as anxious-misery and fear. This study examines the screening utility of four anxiety and depression questionnaires to identify the two internalizing disorder clusters; anxious-misery and fear. Patients with a recent hospital admission for CVD (n = 85, 69.4% males) underwent a structured clinical interview with the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview. The participants also completed the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, Overall Anxiety Severity Impairment Scale (OASIS), and the stress subscale of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS). The PHQ-9 and the GAD-7 yielded appropriate screening properties to detect three different iterations of the anxious-misery cluster (sensitivity >80.95% and specificity >82.81%). The GAD-7 was the only instrument to display favorable screening properties to detect a fear cluster omitting post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; sensitivity 81.25%, specificity 76.81%). These findings indicate that the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 could be implemented to reliably screen for anxious-misery disorders among CVD in-patients, however, the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) to detect fear disorders were contingent on the placement of PTSD and OCD within clusters. The findings are discussed in relation to routine screening guidelines in CVD populations and contemporary understandings of the internalizing disorders.

Its consequences include multifaceted outcomes from complex interactions of sociocultural, environmental, and individual lifestyle factors. This research explores the impacts of socio-cultural environment and lifestyle factors on the psychological health of university students in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Methods: A 15-month follow-up was carried out among 1140 university students from April 2016 to November 2017. Data were collected by using a pre-developed questionnaire, consisting of socio-demographic information, comprehensive lifestyle information, and psychological health information including a nine-item scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for assessing the level of depression, and a 7-item scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for assessing the level of anxiety. The collected data were analyzed by using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software, version 22. Results: With time, there was a 22.5% increase in the prevalence of provisional depression and a 27.1% increase in the prevalence of anxiety. In terms of demographic factors, findings revealed that students dissatisfied with university culture were significantly more likely to experience depression (B = 5.13, p < 0.01, β = 0.33) and anxiety (B = 4.69, p < 0.01, β = 0.34). ‘Being female’, ‘being students of social sciences faculty’, ‘dissatisfaction with current education, financial condition and future career’ were found to be significant predictors of students’ psychological disorders. In terms of lifestyle factors, participants with high and excessive recreational screen time were significantly more vulnerable to depression (B = 1.25, p < 0.01, β = 0.097 and B = 1.75, p < 0.01, β = 0.12) and anxiety (B = 0.86, p = 0.02, β = 0.08 and B = 1.22, p < 0.01, β = 0.096). Additionally, ‘weekly physical inactivity’, ‘dissatisfaction with daily sleep’, ‘short and long sleep duration’, ‘low and high daily meal intake frequency’ and ‘alcohol consumption’ were inextricably linked with students’ depression and anxiety. Conclusion: The prevalence of provisional as well as major depressive and anxiety disorders among university students in Bangladesh is significantly high and augmented in nature. This study provides significant information about the adverse impacts of university socio-cultural environment and students’ lifestyle factors on their psychological health conditions.

Patients in rural areas can access CBT via the internet. The effectiveness of internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) has been consistently shown, but no clinical studies have demonstrated the feasibility of ICBT with real-time therapist support via videoconference for OCD, PD, and SAD at the same time. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of videoconference-delivered CBT for patients with OCD, PD, or SAD. Methods: A total of 30 Japanese participants (mean age 35.4 years, SD 9.2) with OCD, SAD, or PD received 16 sessions of individualized videoconference-delivered CBT with real-time support of a therapist, using tablet personal computer (Apple iPad Mini 2). Treatment involved individualized CBT formulations specific to the presenting diagnosis; all sessions were provided by the same therapist. The primary outcomes were reduction in symptomatology, using the Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive scale (Y-BOCS) for OCD, Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) for PD, and Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) for SAD. The secondary outcomes included the EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) for Quality of Life, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire for anxiety, and Working Alliance Inventory-Short Form (WAI-SF). All primary outcomes were assessed at baseline and at weeks 1 (baseline), 8 (midintervention), and 16 (postintervention) face-to-face during therapy. The occurrence of adverse events was observed after each session. For the primary analysis comparing between pre- and posttreatments, the participants’ points and 95% CIs were estimated by the paired t tests with the change between pre- and posttreatment. Results: A significant reduction in symptom of obsession-compulsion (Y-BOCS = −6.2; Cohen d = 0.74; 95% CI −9.4 to −3.0, P = .002), panic (PDSS = −5.6; Cohen d = 0.89; 95% CI −9.83 to −1.37; P = .02), social anxiety (LSAS = −33.6; Cohen d = 1.10; 95% CI −59.62 to −7.49, P = .02) were observed. In addition, depression (PHQ-9 = −1.72; Cohen d = 0.27; 95% CI −3.26 to −0.19; P = .03) and general anxiety (GAD-7 = −3.03; Cohen d = 0.61; 95% CI −4.57 to −1.49, P < .001) were significantly improved. Although there were no significant changes at 16 weeks from baseline in EQ-5D (0.0336; Cohen d = -0.202; 95% CI −0.0198 to 0.00869; P = .21), there were high therapeutic alliance (ie, WAI-SF) scores (from 68.0 to 73.7) throughout treatment, which significantly increased (4.14; 95% CI 1.24 to 7.04; P = .007). Of the participants, 86% (25/29) were satisfied with videoconference-delivered CBT, and 83% (24/29) preferred videoconference-delivered CBT to face-to-face CBT. An adverse event occurred to a patient with SAD; the incidence was 3% (1/30). Conclusions: Videoconference-delivered CBT for patients with OCD, SAD, and SAD may be feasible and acceptable.

The Mood Mechanic course is a transdiagnostic internet-delivered psychological intervention for symptoms of depression and anxiety, targeted at people aged 18–24 years. The current study compared the efficacy of the course when delivered under strict research trial conditions (research trial; n = 192) with its effectiveness in a routine health-care setting (routine care; n = 222). Methods: Symptoms of depression, anxiety and general distress at baseline, during, and after treatment were measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and Kessler 10-Item Scale (K-10), respectively. Results: Both groups showed significant symptom reductions on all measures at post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. Deterioration rates were low, within-group effect sizes were large (> 1.0) and both groups reported high levels of treatment satisfaction. Patients in routine care were less likely to complete post-treatment or follow-up symptom questionnaires. Limitations: The study is based on self-reported data from treatment-seeking individuals that were motivated enough to start the course, and the absence of a control group and a formal diagnosis in the routine care sample means that some caution is needed in generalising the results. Conclusion: The results show that the Mood Mechanic course is effective and acceptable in routine clinical care, and that online psychological interventions designed for young adults are an effective treatment option for this hard-to-reach group.

Research Method: Data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the effect of varying levels of clinician support was used to examine the effect of involvement in civil litigation on outcome in a free online pain management course. Outcome measures were changes in scores on self-report questionnaires for depression, anxiety, and disability (PHQ-9, GAD-7, and RMDQ) from baseline to 3-month follow-up for those still involved in litigation and those who had completed litigation, compared with outcomes for those who did not report involvement in litigation. The use of regular and as-required opioid medication at assessment and follow-up were also compared. Results: Of the 397 patients enrolled in the pain course, 290 (73.0%) were not involved in litigation, 80 (20.2%) reported involvement in litigation that had been resolved and 27 (6.8%) reported ongoing litigation. Those still involved in litigation had the highest scores on depression scales and the highest rate of opioid use. The completion rates and symptom improvement was lower among current litigants but were still positive, with effect sizes on the outcome measures of between 0.56 and 0.73, as well as a reduction in the use of opioids. Conclusions: Current involvement in compensation litigation was associated with lower treatment completion and less symptom improvement. Nevertheless, the positive findings have significant implications for people involved in workers’ compensation and other litigation who report pain as one of their symptoms.

We further examined the association of these profiles with cardiovascular risk markers. Method: 446 women (mean age = 49.8 ± 17.9 years) and 431 men (mean age = 49.4 ± 17.5 years) from the Dutch general population completed questionnaires on demographics, adverse early life-events (ETI), Type D personality (DS14), anxiety (GAD-7) and depressive (PHQ-9) symptoms, and traditional cardiovascular risk markers. Results: A step-3 latent profile analysis identified three profiles in women (Reference, Type D & trauma, and Type D/no trauma) and four in men (Reference, Type D & trauma, Type D/no trauma, and Physical abuse).

Women in both profiles were older as compared to the Reference group (OR = 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01–1.05). In men, the Type D & trauma profile was associated with increased levels of emotional symptoms (OR = 1.11; 95% CI: 1.03–1.20). There were no significant differences between the profiles in lifestyle factors and cardiometabolic factors. Conclusions: In women, the Type D/no trauma profile and the Type D & trauma profile were associated with a specific combination of cardiovascular risk markers. In men, the Type D & trauma profile was associated with an increased level of emotional symptoms.

Very less is known about loneliness amongst the elderly populations living with various Non-communicable diseases. Aim: The present study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and correlates of loneliness among elderly patients with Non-communicable diseases. Methodology: 296 patients attending the chronic disease clinic of two Community Health Centres were evaluated on University of California, Los Angeles Loneliness Scale (UCLA LS), Geriatric Depression Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7 scale) and Vulnerability to Abuse Screening Scale. Results: More than half (55.4%) of the participants experienced loneliness as per the three item UCLA LS. When the total scores of UCLA scale were used to evaluate the severity of loneliness, half of the study participants had either moderate (N = 39; 13.2%), moderately high (N = 52; 17.6%) and high (N = 55; 18.6%) level of loneliness. Higher proportion of patients experiencing loneliness had anxiety and reported abuse. Significant predictors of loneliness included presence of diabetes mellitus or hypertension, generalized anxiety disorder and abuse. Conclusion: Older adults living with non-communicable diseases are at a higher risk for loneliness. Mutual help groups kind of models can be developed to help in 're-peopling' elderly. Primary health centres should help in improving the overall health and morale amongst the elderly by stamping down their apprehensions and anxieties.

Sense of coherence (SOC), defined as an individual's perceived ability to control events and cope with challenges, is strongly associated with healthcare outcomes. Methods: This study investigated the association between SOC and anxiety among adults in all 47 prefectures of Japan using a cross-sectional online panel survey. SOC was assessed using the University of Tokyo Health Sociology version of the SOC Scale and anxiety was assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale. Results: Among 2100 participants (1051 males and 1049 females), 475 (22.6%) were identified with anxiety (scoring 8 points or higher on the GAD-7 scale). Before adjustment for potential confounders, there was a significant negative association between SOC and presence of anxiety. Even after adjustment, the presence of anxiety was significantly higher among the lower SOC subgroup than the higher SOC subgroup. Conclusions: These results indicate that approximately one-fifth of adults in Japan suffer from anxiety and that low SOC is a significant risk factor.

Comparable psychometric properties across different demographic and linguistic groups are necessary for multiple group comparison and international research on depression and anxiety. Objectives and Method: We examine measurement invariance for the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 by: (a) the sex of the participants, (b) recruitment stratum, and (c) linguistic background. This study is based on non-randomized observational data six months after Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) that were collected in 18 countries. We used multiple methods to detect Differential Item Functioning (DIF) including Item Response Theory, logistic regression, and the Mantel-Haenszel method. Results: At the 6-month post-injury, 2137 (738 [34.5%] women) participants completed the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 questionnaires: 885 [41.4%] patients were primarily admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), 805 [37.7%] were admitted to hospital ward, and 447 [20.9%] were evaluated in the Emergency Room and discharged. Results supported the invariance of PHQ-9 and GAD-7 across sex, patient strata and linguistic background. For different strata three PHQ-9 items and one GAD-7 item and for different linguistic groups only two GAD-7 items were flagged as showing differences in two out of four DIF tests. However, the magnitude of the DIF effect was negligible. Limitation: Despite high number of participants from ICU, patients have mostly mild TBI. Conclusion: The findings demonstrate adequate psychometric properties for PHQ-9 and GAD-7, allowing direct multigroup comparison across sex, strata, and linguistic background.

The Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA) is one of the best psychometrically rated scales and has been validated among Norwegian samples. The purpose of this study was to explore the construct validity of the RSA in an English-speaking Australian sample and test measurement invariance between the Australian sample and a Norwegian sample. An Australian sample (N = 781) completed the RSA, Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC-13), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7). A second sample of Norwegians (N = 320) was included in the analyses of invariance of the RSA across cultures. There were expected negative correlations between RSA and PHQ-9, and between RSA and GAD-7, but positive correlations between RSA and SOC-13. The results indicated that the six-factor measurement model of the RSA is the same in the Australian and Norwegian samples, and respondents from the two cultures understood and interpreted the items in a comparable fashion.

The present study aims to describe the mental health and quality of life of these individuals. Methods: Data, based on 510 individuals, were obtained by means of a questionnaire at open screenings conducted at or nearby refugee housing facilities. Of the participating refugees, 367 were asylum seekers and 143 had received a residence permit but were still awaiting a more permanent housing solution. The questionnaire included measures of depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), symptoms of anxiety (GAD-7), risk of having post-traumatic stress disorder (PC-PTSD), and quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF). Results: Of the total sample, 56–58.4% reported clinically significant levels of symptoms of depression, anxiety and risk of having PTSD. Prevalence estimates were higher among asylum seekers than among those who had received their residence permit. Quality of life was generally rated below population norms and correlated negatively with mental health outcomes. Conclusions: Individuals residing in refugee housing facilities show high levels of psychological distress and rate their quality of life as low. Asylum seekers score higher than those having received a residence permit. These results are troublesome since the wait time for asylum decisions has lengthened considerably after 2015. The results of the present study calls for the urgency of societal actions to shorten the asylum process and improve conditions at the housing facilities.

In the present study, the psychological impact of S. invicta stings was evaluated using a questionnaire that included a previously published posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) checklist, the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, 5th scale (PSQI(5)). A total of 96 valid questionnaires were obtained; 37 participants were placed in the stung group, and 59 participants were placed in the unstung group.

While it is well known that epilepsy can have an impact on cognitive abilities, there is conflicting evidence in the literature on the relationship between migraine and cognitive function. The aim of this study was to assess whether migraine comorbidity in patients with newly diagnosed focal epilepsy is associated with cognitive dysfunction. Methods: This is a post hoc analysis of data prospectively collected for the Human Epilepsy Project (HEP). There were 349 participants screened for migraine with the 13 questions used in the American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention (AMPP) study. Participants were also screened for depression using the Neurological Disorder Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDI-E) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and for anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale. Cognitive performance was assessed with the Cogstate Brief Battery and Aldenkamp–Baker Neuropsychological Assessment Schedule (ABNAS). Results: About a fifth (21.2%) of patients with a new diagnosis of focal epilepsy screened positive for migraine. There were more women and less participants employed full time among the participants with comorbid migraine. They reported slightly more depressive and anxious symptoms than the participants without migraine. Migraine comorbidity was associated with ABNAS memory score (median: 2, range: 0–12, Mann Whitney U p-value: 0.015). However, migraine comorbidity was not associated with Cogstate scores nor ABNAS total scores or other ABNAS domain scores. In linear regressions, depression and anxiety scores were associated with the ABNAS memory score. Conclusion: In this study, there was no association between migraine comorbidity and objective cognitive scores in patients with newly diagnosed focal epilepsy. The relationship between migraine comorbidity and subjective memory deficits seemed to be mediated by the higher prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms in patients with epilepsy with comorbid migraine.

A pilot trial of the tetracycline minocycline as adjunctive treatment in treatment-resistant depression (TRD), produced promising results, however, a larger scale trial is needed to confirm the antidepressant actions of this drug. Methods: This is a 12-week double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of minocycline as an add-on to standard antidepressants for adults (age > 18) with DSM-5 major depressive episode, who have failed to respond to at least two adequate trials of antidepressant treatment. It is a parallel-arm study with 50 participants in each group. The primary outcome measure is change in 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRSD-17) total scores from baseline to week 12. Secondary measures include the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, World Health Organization Quality of Life Short Version (WHOQOL-BREF) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7). Peripheral inflammatory biomarkers will be collected at baseline, week 6 and 12. Discussion: If minocycline is well tolerated and effective in reducing depressive symptoms in patients with TRD, it would warrant genuine consideration as a treatment option for TRD. Additionally, if results demonstrate that minocycline has antidepressant properties, and that changes in inflammatory status are associated with its antidepressant action, it will inform the development of individualized treatment for a subset of patients with MDD.

Similar studies are lacking in Southern European populations. We aimed to examine the associations of anxiety and depressive symptoms, and substance use with NEET status in a large, randomized population-based sample in Greece. Methods: A telephone structured questionnaire was conducted in a representative sample of 2771 young Greeks aged 15–24 years. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed with GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scales, respectively. Substances use and several sociodemographic parameters were also examined. Results: In our sample 16.4% were NEETs. In multivariate analyses, NEETs compared to non-NEETs were older, with lower family income, without insurance and more likely to be married and smoke. Furthermore, NEET status was associated with a higher GAD-7 score among older NEETs and long-term NEETs (NEETs unemployed for more than a year). Moreover, being NEET among older participants was associated with severe symptoms of anxiety and moderate/severe symptoms of depression. Limitations: This was a telephone survey and a clinical evaluation of the patients was not performed. Furthermore, the structured interview was not designed to detect the level of substance use or the reasons for being NEET. Conclusions: NEET status is frequent among young Greeks. Older, and long-term NEETs appear to be at higher risk for presenting anxiety/depression symptoms. Whether NEET status is associated with adverse outcomes later in life requires longitudinal studies.

The evidence of the effectiveness of IAPT has been demonstrated in multiple studies from the UK, USA, Australia and other countries. MindStep™ is the first adaptation of IAPT in Australia, delivered completely by telephone, targeting people with a recent history of a hospital admission for mental illnesses within the private health system. This paper reports on the outcome of the first 17 months of MindStep™ implemented across Australia from March 2016. Methods: This prospective observational study investigated the MindStep™ program in a cohort of clients with a recent hospitalisation for mental illnesses. The study used quantitative methods to compare pre-post treatment clinical measures (N = 680) using Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7). This study also included in-depth interviews with participants (N = 14) and coaches (N = 4) to determine the feasibility and acceptability of the program. Results: Of the 867 clients referred to MindStep™, 757 had initial assessments by phone making an enrolment rate of 87.3%. Following assessment, 680 commenced treatment and of them, 427 (62.7%) completed treatment. According to ‘per-protocol’ analysis (N = 427), there was a large effect size for post-treatment PHQ-9 (d = 1.03) and GAD-7 (d = 0.99) scores; reliable recovery rate was 62% (95% CI: 57–68%). For intent-to-treat analysis using multiple imputation (N = 680), effect sizes were also large for pre-post treatment change: PHQ-9 (d = 0.78) and GAD-7 (d = 0.76). The reliable recovery rate was 49% (95% CI: 45–54%). Qualitative findings supported these claims where participants were positive about MindStep™ and found the telephone delivery and use of mental health coaches highly acceptable. Conclusions: MindStep™ has demonstrated encouraging outcomes that suggest LiCBT can be successfully delivered to people with a history of hospital admissions for anxiety and depressive disorders and achieve target recovery rates of > 50%. Other promising evaluation findings indicate the MindStep™ option is acceptable, feasible and safe within the stepped models of mental health care delivery in Australia.

The study aimed to assess panic and anxiety among individuals in the general Bangladesh population early in the COVID-19 outbreak. Methodology: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from March 29 to April 06, 2020, involving 1311 community-dwelling individuals aged between 13 and 63 years and residing in Bangladesh. After providing informed consent, participants completed an online survey assessing socio-demographic variables and using the Panic Disorder Severity Scale and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) to assess panic and anxiety symptomatology, respectively. Binary logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results: Estimates of panic and generalized anxiety were 79.6%, and 37.3%, respectively. Factors statistically predicting panic were being older (more than 30 years), having higher education (above bachelor), being married, and living with a joint family. Factors statistically predicting generalized anxiety were being female, being older (more than 30 years), having higher education (above bachelor), being married, being a non-governmental employee. Limitations: As this study employs the cross-sectional and self-reported measures, causal inferences cannot be indicated. Sampling biases may have influenced estimates of panic and generalized anxiety. Conclusion: Sizable proportions of respondents reported panic and generalized anxiety in the setting of COVID-19. The findings suggest the need for additional surveillance of panic and generalized anxiety through longitudinal assessments. Evidence-based intervention programs and supportive services to address panic and generalized anxiety appear important for Bangladeshi individuals during this stage (and likely later stages) of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis on data of users of COSIP and users of PO. Database was the routine assessment (demographic and disease‐related characteristics, GAD‐7, PHQ‐9, EORTC QLQ‐C30, and current concerns) of an outpatient psycho‐oncological clinic with additional child‐centred counselling. A total of 151 patients and 49 partners with children ≤ 21 years were included. We conducted descriptive analyses and group comparisons. Results: Fifty‐nine patients and partners used COSIP only or additionally to individual psycho‐oncological service. PO users were more depressed and were more anxious than COSIP users. Patients using PO reported worse emotional functioning than patients using COSIP. Partners using PO reported worse global quality of life and more symptoms of fatigue than partners using COSIP. With regard to current concerns, patients using COSIP reported child‐related issues more frequently than PO users. PO users reported symptoms of anxiety, depressive symptoms, or exhaustion more frequently than COSIP users. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that patients and partners self‐referring to PO or COSIP are highly burdened. COSIP users experience different psychosocial burden than PO users. As poor mental state of parents is a risk factor for the development of mental problems in children, parents using only PO may benefit from additional child‐centred support. Accordingly, the need for COSIP should be assessed continuously during PO of patients with children ≤ 21 years.

More than half of the participants (61.2%) were U.S. citizens and 33% (n = 60) had a partner living outside the U.S. It was hypothesized that (a) perceived stress contributed to anxiety and depression, and (b) resilience would moderate the effects of perceived stress on levels of anxiety and depression. Individuals in same-sex binational relationships in this study reported higher levels of perceived stress compared with the general population normative data found in previous studies. Their scores from the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) suggested a severe level of anxiety and the presence of significant depressive symptoms. As hypothesized, structural equation modeling analysis found that perceived stress significantly contributed to both depression and anxiety. In addition, resilience had a moderating and buffering effect on the negative impact perceived stress had on depression, which has clinical implications in prevention and interventions for LGB individuals in same-sex binational relationships.

In the original article, there were errors in Table 5 and in the abstract. The corrections are given in the erratum.] Background: Heterogeneity in the prognosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) patients may be explained by relatively stable individual psychological differences. Therefore, we studied multiple personality and coping traits using a person-centered approach, and examined the predictive value of this approach for patient-reported outcomes. Method: 657 CAD patients (age = 66.39 ± 10.6; 79% men) completed multiple self-report questionnaires focusing on demographics, negative affectivity and social inhibition (DS14), neuroticism and extraversion (EPQ), resilience (DRS-15), and coping styles (CISS) after undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and treatment adherence (MOS) were assessed at 6 months follow-up. Clinical information was extracted from patients’ medical records. Results: A step-3 latent class analysis identified four subgroup profiles: Low distress (31%), Passive coping (21%), Active coping (20%), and High distress (28%). For all patient-reported outcomes, overall significant differences between the subgroups were observed (p-values < .05). The High distress profile was associated with the highest levels of emotional distress (d’s > .94), and lowest levels of positive mood (d = −1.02) and treatment adherence (d = −2.75) at follow-up. Patients with an Activecoping profile also experienced increased emotional distress (d’s > .50), but participated in cardiac rehabilitation most often (d = .13), and reported high levels of positive mood (d = −1.02). Patients with a Passive coping profile displayed few emotional problems after six months (d’s < .30), but participation to cardiac rehabilitation was relatively low (d = .04). Conclusions: This study revealed four distinct psychological latent subgroups, which were predictive of patient-reported outcomes. The results indicate that a person-centered approach is useful in explaining heterogeneity in recovery from PCI, and may enhance personalized medicine in patients with CAD.

The aim of this study was to compare the plasma NPS levels in patients suffering from generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and those of healthy controls. Methods: A total of 40 subjects diagnosed with GAD and 40 healthy controls were recruited in the study. The Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) were administered to all participants to determine the severity of participants’ anxiety and concomitant depressive symptoms. The plasma NPS levels were measured from the fasting venous blood samples obtained from each participant. Results: The median plasma NPS level was found to be significantly higher in the GAD group in comparison to the control group (28.8 pg/ mL as against 19.1 pg/mL, p = 0.01). A significant positive correlation was observed between the plasma NPS levels and HAM-A scores (rs = 0.23, p = 0.04) as well as the GAD-7 scores (rs = 0.28, p = 0.01). The p-value obtained from the correlation analysis between the plasma NPS levels and HAM-D scores was 0.052. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that the plasma NPS levels could enable the identification of GAD with 67.5% sensitivity and 62.5% specificity, when the cut-off value was determined as 25.06 pg/mL. Conclusions: Our results support the view that plasma NPS levels, which has demonstrated anxiolytic effects on the central nervous system, is related to the severity of anxiety in GAD and could be considered as a candidate marker for the identification of GAD.

However, they are not always feasible to deliver due a shortage of trained therapists and demands on the patient. An online trauma-focused Guided Self-Help (GSH) programme which could overcome these barriers has shown promise in a pilot study. This study will be the first to evaluate GSH against standard face-to-face therapy to assess its suitability for use in the NHS. Methods: The study is a large-scale multi-centre pragmatic randomised controlled non-inferiority trial, with assessors masked to treatment allocation. One hundred and ninety-two participants will be randomly allocated to receive either face-to-face trauma-focused cognitive behaviour therapy (TFCBT) or trauma-focused online guided self-help (GSH). The primary outcome will be the severity of symptoms of PTSD over the previous week as measured by the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM5 (CAPS-5) at 16 weeks post-randomisation. Secondary outcome measures include PTSD symptoms over the previous month as measured by the CAPS-5 at 52 weeks plus the Impact of Event Scale—revised (IES-R), Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Alcohol Use Disorders Test (AUDIT-O), Multidimensional Scale for Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), short Post-Traumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and General Self Efficacy Scale (GSES) measured at 16 and 52 weeks post-randomisation. Changes in health-related quality of life will be measured by the EQ-5D and the level of healthcare resource utilisation for health economic analysis will be determined by an amended version of the Client Socio-Demographic and Service Receipt Inventory European Version. The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ) will be collected at 16 weeks post-randomisation to evaluate treatment satisfaction. Discussion: This study will be the first to compare online GSH with usual face-to-face therapy for PTSD. The strengths are that it will test a rigorously developed intervention in a real world setting to inform NHS commissioning. The potential challenges of delivering such a pragmatic study may include participant recruitment, retention and adherence, therapist retention, and fidelity of intervention delivery.

To create a classifier for SI based on variables of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) and sociodemographic variables, and to obtain an upper bound on the best possible performance of a predictor based on those variables. Methods: From a consecutive sample of 9025 primary care patients, 6805 eligible patients (60% female; mean age = 51.5 years) participated. Advanced methods of machine learning were used to derive the prediction equation. Various classifiers were applied and the area under the curve (AUC) was computed as a performance measure. Results: Classifiers based on methods of machine learning outperformed ordinary regression methods and achieved AUCs around 0.87. The key variables in the prediction equation comprised four items - namely feelings of depression/hopelessness, low self-esteem, worrying, and severe sleep disturbances. The generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7) and the somatic symptom subscale (PHQ-15) did not enhance prediction substantially. Conclusions: In predicting suicidal ideation researchers should refrain from using ordinary regression tools. The relevant information is primarily captured by the depression subscale and should be incorporated in a nonlinear model. For clinical practice, a classification tree using only four items of the whole PHQ may be advocated.

However, we know very little about the prevalence of and recovery from PE in primary mental health care settings, such as the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services in the UK National Health Service (NHS), where most CMD are treated. Methods: We used the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences—Positive 15-item Scale (CAPE-P15) to determine the prevalence of PE in patients receiving treatment from IAPT services. Patient-reported measures of depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) are routinely collected and establish recovery in IAPT services. We studied recovery rates according to the absence and presence of PE. Multi-group growth models estimated improvement trajectories for each group. Results: A total of 2,042 patients with CMD completed the CAPE-P15. The mean age was 39.8. The overall prevalence of PE was 29.68%. The recovery rate was 27.43% compared to 62.08% for those without PE. Although patients with or without PE shared similar improvement trajectories, the initial severity of patients with PE impeded their likelihood of recovery. Limitations: We mirrored routine data collection in IAPT services, including self-report questionnaires that may affect valid reporting of symptoms. Missing data in the calculation of improvement trajectories may reduce generalisability. Conclusions: At least one in four patients receiving treatment from IAPT services in primary care experience CMD and PE.

Adolescents aged between 11 and 20 years who were living in Mainland China, attending junior or senior secondary schools, and were willing to participate were included in this study. All participants and their guardians provided informed consent before participating in the study. The self-reported seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) Scale was used to assess the symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder and the severity during the preceding 2 weeks according to the DSM-IV criteria. The prevalence rates of mild, moderate, and severe anxiety were 14.5%, 3.1%, and 1.5%, respectively. In conclusion, anxiety was prevalent among adolescents during the COVID-19 outbreak, especially in girls and in senior secondary school students, suggesting that timely screening and appropriate interventions are urgently needed to reduce anxiety in adolescents.

However, little is known about the influence of length of stay, living conditions, and residence permission in the host country or about the duration of the escape journey and travel conditions on mental health in this refugee population. This study examines the mental health of Syrian refugees, taking into account the circumstances in their country of origin and host country, as well as their escape conditions. Methods: This investigation formed part of a registry-based study. A sample of 518 adult Syrian refugees in Erlangen, Germany, who have residence permission was identified. The response rate was 38.6%; a total of 200 Syrian refugees thus participated in the study. The respondents were investigated for post-traumatic stress disorder (ETI), depression (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety (GAD-7) and post-migration variables. Results: The prevalence of participants who had personally experienced and/or witnessed traumatic events was 75.3%. Symptoms of PTSD were found in 11.4% of the participants. Moderate to severe depression was confirmed in 14.5% and moderate to severe generalized anxiety in 13.5% of the sample. The criteria for at least one diagnosis were met by 30.5% of the participants. More severe PTSD symptoms were associated with older age, shorter validity of the residence permit, larger number of traumatic events (TEs) and higher generalized anxiety symptoms. Depression symptoms were associated with younger age, shorter duration of escape journey, larger number of TEs and higher generalized anxiety symptoms. Generalized anxiety symptoms correlated with female gender, PTSD, and depression symptoms. Conclusions: These findings suggest that Syrian refugees in Germany are a vulnerable population, especially if they have experienced and/or witnessed multiple traumatic events. However, post-migration conditions and positive future prospects in the host country can be protective factors for this population.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted six months after the earthquake. The multi-stage random sampling method was applied to a selection of respondents from district schools. A total of 321 students participated in the study. In addition to generating demographic data, a brief PTSD inventory, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire and the Disaster Impact Questionnaire (DIQ) were administered. Results: Approximately 58.3%, 16.8% and 32.1% of adolescents reported the clinical symptoms of PTSD, depression and anxiety, respectively. The associations and comorbidity between PTSD, depression, and anxiety were statistically significant (p = 0.001). Gender, depression, having directly seen someone injured or trapped, the injury or hospitalization of a member of the nuclear family and being afraid to stay inside a building since the earthquake were demonstrated to be the significant predictors for PTSD. The injury and hospitalization of a member of the nuclear family and feeling stressed after the earthquake were significant predictors for depression. Having been injured, having one’s house destroyed; being afraid to stay inside a building and gender were significant predictors for generalized anxiety disorder. Conclusions: The prevalence of PTSD in the current study population is relatively high and the fact that a significant number of adolescents were afraid to stay inside a building following the earthquake calls for further investigation and treatments.

Prisoners commonly experience psychological distress, but interventions to address this are currently lacking. We aimed to examine the link between prospective mental imagery and anxiety and depression among prisoners. One hundred twenty-three male prisoners from a Category C prison in southwest England participated in the study. They completed the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the General Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) to measure whether they experience depression and/or anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, they completed additional questionnaires to evaluate their prospective mental imagery. Results showed that 67.5% of prisoners presented with more depression symptoms and 27.7% with more anxiety symptoms. Supporting earlier findings, our data revealed that some dimensions of prospective mental imagery were significantly related with increased anxiety and depression symptoms in prisoners. Namely, intrusive negative personally relevant imagery was a positive predictor and likelihood of positive events a negative predictor of both anxiety and depression symptoms. The perceived likelihood of negative events was a positive predictor of depression. Intrusive verbal thought was a positive predictor of anxiety. The obtained results suggest the need to develop interventions not only targeting the reduction of prospective negative imagery but also the enhancement of positive mental imagery.

Methods: Depressive symptoms and anxiety were assessed in 395 adult patients with primary diagnoses of neurological disorders. The Patient Health Questionnaire nine-item depression scale (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder seven-item scale (GAD-7) were administered. Demographic details of the patients were recorded. Referral to and attendance of psychiatric services were recorded for patients scoring within the clinical range of depression and anxiety disorders (scores > 10). Results: There was a 39% prevalence rate of depressive symptoms, 34% rate of anxiety, and 35.4% concurrent rate of both disorders in this cohort. The referral rate to psychiatric services was 33.6%, and attendance rate was 47.8%. There was significant association between severity of psychiatric symptoms and referral to psychiatric services, as well as significant association between comorbid psychiatric symptoms and attendance to psychiatric services. Conclusion: Our results indicate similar prevalence rates of comorbid psychiatric symptoms to studies carried out in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and relatively high attendance and referral rates to psychiatric services.

Patients undergoing treatment (N = 1201), both inpatient and outpatient patients, completed the GAD-7 at pre- and post-treatment. Measures of depression, well-being, and other anxiety measures were also completed, making it possible to investigate convergent and divergent validity. Internal consistency and convergent validity were excellent for the total sample, and there was acceptable variation related to treatment groups. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on a random sample (50%) of the patients at intake and then conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to confirm the factor structure in the other part of the sample at intake. The EFA indicated a clear one-factor solution, but the one-factor solution with CFA provided a poor fit to the data. Correlating the residuals among items assessing somatic symptoms led to a good fit in a respecified CFA solution.

It is important for college counseling center staff in Turkey to have access to screening instruments to identify students with high risk for college life adjustment difficulties. The purpose of this study was to validate a Turkish version of the Inventory of Common Problems (ICP; Hoffman and Weiss 1986) for Turkish college students. Two hundreds and thirty-five Turkish university students participated in this study. Factorial structure of the ICP was evaluated using exploratory factor analysis, resulting in a four-factor structure with the internal consistency reliability coefficients for all factors being excellent to average: (a) emotional problems (Cronbach’s α = .90), (b) academic problems (α = .80), (c) substance use problems (α = .77), and (d) physical health problems (α = .73). The emotional problems factor, academic problems factor, and physical health problems factor were significantly associated with perceived stress, depression, and anxiety in the expected direction, as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10; Cohen and Williamson 1988), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; Kroenke et al. 2001) and General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) Scale (Spitzer et al. 2006).

Bariatric surgery is an effective strategy that produces durable long-term weight loss. There is a bidirectional interplay between mental health and obesity; with higher depression and anxiety in the obese population as well as significant effects on weight loss for people with mental health disorders. Objective: Our cross-sectional study aimed to examine psychosocial predictors of cognition for the pre-operative bariatric surgery population and its effect on work productivity. Methods: Demographic data, perceived cognitive deficits (PDQ-5), depression scale (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), Quality of life (SF36) and work impairment (LEAPS) was collected from 302 pre-operative bariatric surgery candidates at their initial assessment. Multiple regression was conducted with perceived cognitive deficits as the dependent variable. A secondary analysis was done controlling for anxiety and depression. Results: Variables that were significantly associated with perceived cognition were anxiety, depression, work productivity and overall mental health quality of life. Perceived cognition was also significantly associated with work impairment independent of mood symptoms. Discussion: Anxiety and depression are prevalent in the pre-operative bariatric surgery population, significantly affecting cognition, and should be routinely screened. Work performance was also affected by cognition in our population but the link between obesity and cognition needs to be further explored.

(chamomile) extract in subjects with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) with or without comorbid depression. It was hypothesized that chamomile extract would demonstrate similar anxiolytic activity in both subgroups, but superior antidepressant activity in GAD subjects with comorbid depression. Design: As part of a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of chamomile extract for relapse prevention of GAD, 179 subjects received initial therapy with open-label chamomile extract 1500 mg daily for 8 weeks. Linear mixed-effect models were used to identify clinically meaningful changes in anxiety and depression symptoms between diagnostic subgroups. Settings/Location: The study took place at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, PA. Subjects: Subjects were ≥ 18 years old with a primary DSM IV-TR diagnosis of GAD. They were subcategorized into two diagnostic groups: GAD without comorbid depression (n = 100) and GAD with comorbid depression (n = 79). Interventions: Open-label chamomile extract 1500 mg was given daily for 8 weeks. Outcome measures: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7), Hamilton rating scale for anxiety, Beck anxiety inventory, Hamilton rating scale for depression (HRSD), the six-item core HRSD (items 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 13), and the Beck depression inventory (BDI). Results: The authors observed similar anxiolytic effects over time in both diagnostic subgroups. However, there was a greater reduction in HRSD core symptom scores (p < 0.023), and a trend level reduction in HRSD total scores (p = 0.14) and in BPI total scores (p = 0.060) in subjects with comorbid depression. Conclusions: M. chamomilla L. may produce clinically meaningful antidepressant effects in addition to its anxiolytic activity in subjects with GAD and comorbid depression. Future controlled trials in subjects with primary major depressive disorder are needed to validate this preliminary observation.

Evidence links HF to cognitive decline, obesity, and psychological distress. The current study examined the association between cognitive function and ejection fraction (EF%), anxiety, depression, and obesity in inpatient HF. Patients completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item Scale (PHQ-9), and Mini-Cog while hospitalized for HF. Additional demographic and medical information was gathered via chart review. All models controlled for age. Of 117 patients assessed (49% male), 55% (n = 64) were obese. ANCOVA analyses were conducted comparing those with obesity and without on cognitive function: model A included EF%, model B included depression, and model C included anxiety. All three models were significantly related to cognitive function. There was a significant interaction effect of EF% and obesity and of anxiety and obesity to predict Mini-Cog scores. Post hoc partial correlational analyses revealed that anxiety was negatively associated with Mini-Cog scores among only patients without obesity. Depression was not significantly related to cognitive function in either group. However, patients with obesity demonstrated higher depression and anxiety than patients without. Results suggest that at lower EF%, and with higher anxiety, patients without obesity may be at greater risk of cognitive dysfunction than those with obesity. Cognitive dysfunction among HF patients with obesity may be independent of psychological distress. These findings may reflect the 'obesity paradox' observed among HF patients, in that patients with obesity may have a different biopsychosocial presentation, which may lead to unexpected clinical outcomes. Further research is necessary to articulate the relationship of obesity and cognitive function in HF.

The value of perinatal AD screening is well established but there is very limited evidence to support the applicability of existing anxiety screening instruments. To our knowledge, no previous studies have evaluated an AD screening instrument in a perinatal population using full gold standard methodology. Objective: To assess the accuracy of the most commonly used and/or recommended screening tools for perinatal AD (i.e., the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and its anxiety subscale (EPDS-3A), and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 and 2-item Scales (GAD-7 and GAD-2) alongside a clinically derived alternative; the Anxiety Disorder-13 (AD-13). Methods: 310 Canadian women completed mood and anxiety questionnaires at approximately 3-months postpartum. Those scoring at/above cut-off on one or more questionnaire completed a diagnostic interview for depression and all AD (n = 115). The accuracy of each scale was assessed via ROC analyses. Results: Only the AD-13 met the standard of a clinically useful screening measure, with an area under the curve (AUC) above 0.8. This was achieved with and without the inclusion of the related disorders. No other measure demonstrated an AUC above 0.8, either including or excluding the related disorders. Conclusions: Neither the EPDS/EPDS 3-A, nor the GAD-7/GAD-2 can be recommended for widespread use as a perinatal AD screening tool. The high performance of the AD-13 is a good indication that an effective alternative is well within reach.

Little is known about similar problems in developing countries, particularly the Arab region. The goal of this study was to assess the frequency of selected psychiatric problems among college students in two Arab countries: Qatar and Lebanon, and to compare them to the USA. Methods: The Healthy Minds Study, an online confidential survey of common psychiatric symptoms designed for college campuses was used. We used the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to screen for major depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) to screen for generalized anxiety and the SCOFF questionnaire to screen for eating disorders. Comparisons were made using ANOVA, Chi-Square tests and logistic regressions. Results: A total of 1841 students participated in the study. The rates of depression (PHQ-9 ≥ 12), generalized anxiety (GAD-7 ≥ 10) and eating disorders (SCOFF≥3) at the combined Arab universities were 34.6, 36.1 and 20.4% respectively. The corresponding rates in the USA were: 12.8, 15.9 and 6.8% (p < 0.001 for all measures). The impact of psychiatric problems on functioning in general and academic performance in particular was more severe in the Arab countries compared to the USA (p < 0.001). Independent predictors of psychiatric problems in general included location, female gender, financial difficulties and poor grades. Being religious had a protective association with mental health. Conclusion: The rates of depression, anxiety and eating disorders were significantly higher among college students in Qatar and Lebanon compared to the USA. Additional research is needed to determine whether these results reflect methodological limitations or true differences in psychopathology across these populations. If replicated, the results indicate that the psychiatric problems on college campuses in the USA are a microcosm of a global problem that needs global solutions.

We investigated sensitivity to change and minimal clinically important difference of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Methods: This study included all participants from a multisite trial of chronic depression. Baseline and follow-up (12 and 48 weeks) data were used to assess treatment response. Effect sizes (ES) and standardized response means (SRM) of pre- and post-GAD-7 mean changes were calculated for subgroups of patients, who did or did not improve according to ratings in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-24). Results: N = 261 patients were included in the analyses. In the subgroup of patients who improved according to HRSD-24, GAD-7 scores were significantly lower after 12 weeks (t = −6.31, df = 120, p < .001; ES = −0.51, SRM = −0.57), and 48 weeks of treatment (t = −12.68, df = 141, p < .001; ES = −1.0, SRM = −1.7), when compared to admission. In the group who worsened, GAD-7 scores were significantly higher after 12 weeks (t = 2.96, df = 41, p = .005; ES = 0.30, SRM = 0.46), and increased after 48 weeks (t = 1.99, df = 21, p = .059; ES = 0.37, SRM = 0.43), when compared to baseline. The unchanged group showed no significant difference between baseline and follow-up. MCID was estimated 4 points on the GAD-7 total score. Limitations: Confirmation of these findings and further investigation of the GAD-7 in populations and trials focusing on anxiety-specific treatment is highly recommended.

Smoking remains the largest modifiable risk factor for this health inequality, but people with severe mental illness have not historically engaged with smoking cessation services. We aimed to test the effectiveness of a combined behavioral and pharmacological smoking cessation intervention targeted specifically at people with severe mental illness. In the smoking cessation intervention for severe mental illness (SCIMITAR+) trial, a pragmatic, randomized controlled study, we recruited heavy smokers with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia from 16 primary care and 21 community-based mental health sites in the UK. Participants were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, and smoked at least five cigarettes per day. Exclusion criteria included substantial comorbid drug or alcohol problems and people who lacked capacity to consent at the time of recruitment. Using computer-generated random numbers, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to a bespoke smoking cessation intervention or to usual care. Participants, mental health specialists, and primary care physicians were unmasked to assignment. The bespoke smoking cessation intervention consisted of behavioral support from a mental health smoking cessation practitioner and pharmacological aids for smoking cessation, with adaptations for people with severe mental illness—such as, extended pre-quit sessions, cut down to quit, and home visits. Access to pharmacotherapy was via primary care after discussion with the smoking cessation specialist. Under usual care participants were offered access to local smoking cessation services not specifically designed for people with severe mental illnesses. The primary endpoint was smoking cessation at 12 months ascertained via carbon monoxide measurements below 10 parts per million and self-reported cessation for the past 7 days. Secondary endpoints were biologically verified smoking cessation at 6 months; number of cigarettes smoked per day, Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) and Motivation to Quit (MTQ) questionnaire; general and mental health functioning determined via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire, and 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12); and body-mass index (BMI).

Analyzing the networked relationships concurrently could be a more substantive approach to better understand the role of risk factors in this population. This study aimed to assess the magnitude of mental health symptoms as well as the association among socio-demographic, trafficking related exposure variables, and mental health problems of Ethiopian returnees from trafficking. Methods: A sample of 1387 returnees who were trafficked via three major human trafficking corridors of Ethiopia were selected consecutively. Data related to socio-economic, trafficking exposure variables, and symptoms of mental illness were collected in personal interviews. Anxiety was measured with a brief measure for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7), depression with a patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9), and PTSD with post-traumatic checklist (PCL-C). Generalized structural equation modeling was employed to estimate the relationships among exogenous, mediating, and endogenous variables simultaneously. Results: The prevalence of symptoms of anxiety was estimated at 51.9% (95% CI 49.3–54.6%); PTSD was estimated at 34.5% (95% CI 32.1–37.1%) and depression at 58.3% (95% CI 55.6–60.9%). Restricted freedom of movement had a direct positive effect on anxiety (β = 1.24, 95% CI 0.97–1.51), depression (β = 0.94, 95% CI 0.71–1.17) and PTSD (13.00, 95% CI 11.23–14.77). Violence experienced during the trafficking period was a mediator variable and significantly associated with anxiety (β = 0.46; 95% CI 0.26–0.66) and PTSD (β = 4.00; 95% CI 2.06–5.94). History of detention had a positive total effect on GAD (total β = 1.380, 95% CI 1.074–1.687) and PTSD (total β = 15.63, 95% CI 13.708–17.545), and direct positive effect on depression (β = 0.89, 95% CI 0.65–1.13). Conclusion: Ethiopian trafficked persons were highly likely to return with increased levels of mental health symptoms, namely anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Socio-economic and trafficking related exposures mediated by violence were factors affecting mental health symptoms. Thus, in addition to economic re-integrations of victims, strategies should be designed and implemented to address the prevalent mental health problems.

Methods: We examined 234 patients aged 18 to 84 years attending an interdisciplinary outpatient clinic for patients with CPPS in Hamburg, Germany. Using self-reports, we assessed CPPS symptom severity (NIH-CPSI), with the female counterpart of each male anatomical site used in the questionnaire for women; physical and mental QoL (SF-12) as well as symptoms of depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7); pain catastrophizing cognitions (PCS); social support (F-SozU) and medication intake. The presence of trigger and tender points was assessed in a physiotherapy examination. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was calculated to analyze the contribution of somatic and psychosocial variables on CPPS symptom severity. Analyses were repeated with physical and mental QoL as outcomes. Results: In the overall model, the intake of pain medication (B = 3.78, SE = 1.25, p = .006), the presence of depressive symptoms (B = 0.40, SE = 0.15, p = .01) and pain catastrophizing (B = 0.18, SE = 0.05, p = .001) significantly predicted CPPS symptom severity. Corresponding analyses revealed a differential pattern of factors predicting physical and mental QoL, whereas higher levels of depressive symptoms were consistently associated with diminished mental (B = −0.63; p < .001) and physical QoL (B = −0.85; p < .001). Conclusion: Present results emphasize the importance of psychosocial factors, in particular of depression, in CPPS symptom severity and both physical and mental QoL and give support to an integrated treatment concept encompassing both psychological support and somatic aspects of the disease.

This study identifies clinical vulnerabilities for suicidal ideation in cardiac patients. Methods: The primary outcome of the study was severity of suicidal ideation as measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ‐9) item No. 9. Covariates were demographics, cardiac characteristics (i.e., Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina rating of chest pain and New York Heart Association rating of shortness of breath), depression (PHQ‐8,i.e., PHQ‐9 minus item No. 9), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder‐7, GAD‐7), somatic symptoms (PHQ‐15), illness perception (Brief‐Illness Perception Questionnaire), and health‐related quality of life (EuroQol‐5D, EQ 5D). Results: Data from 1,976 patients were analysed. At least 14% (95% CI [12%, 16%]) of patients indicated suicidal ideations within the last 2 weeks. Bivariate analyses yielded associations between suicidal ideation and higher levels of depression severity, anxiety severity, somatic symptom burden, chest pain, shortness of breath, negative illness perceptions, reduced health‐related quality of life, and a higher probability of living alone (all p < 0.001). A multivariable ordinal regression revealed depression severity and anxiety severity to show the highest associations with suicidal ideation (ORPHQ‐8 = 1.22, p < 0.001; ORGAD‐7 = 1.09, p < 0.001). Having a defibrillator implant was associated with a lower probability of suicidal ideation (OR = 0.27, p = 0.017).

The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) is an instrument for the assessment of anxiety. The main objective of this work was to compare general anxiety levels between cancer survivors and individuals without a history of cancer in a population-based study (LIFE-ADULT) with 10,000 participants. Methods: All participants (18–80 years) completed the GAD-7 and other psychological and medical questionnaires. A score of 10 or greater for GAD-7 (of total 21) indicates a probable generalized anxiety disorder. Results: 954 participants reported a diagnosis of cancer in their medical history. In the multivariate analysis an anxiety disorder was associated with prior cancer diagnosis (OR: 1.8; 95% CI [1.4–2.4]), age -every additional year- (OR: 0.983; [0.976–0.991]), female gender (OR: 1.8; [1.5–2.2]) and low socioeconomic status (OR: 2.0; [1.7–2.5]) all p < 0.001. There were no significant associations between general anxiety and other comorbidities, such as myocardial infarction (OR: 1.0; p = 0.948), stroke (OR: 1.4; p = 0.237) or diabetes (OR: 1.0; p = 0.326). There was also no significant difference in anxiety disorder among cancer survivors regarding the time passed since the initial cancer diagnosis (OR: 1.1; [0.6–1.9], p = 0.804 comparing 5–10 years after a diagnosis of cancer vs. ≤ 5 years and OR: 0.6; [0.4–1.1], p = 0.107 comparing > 10 vs. ≤ 5 years).

The aim of the present study was to develop a short-form version of the CSS, removing the 'Mistrust' subscale. Participants were undergraduate students from two UK universities (N = 661, 73% female, Mage = 22.19 years, SD = 5.88). Students completed the CSS, Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7). Twelve items were chosen for retention in the short form based on an exploratory factor analysis. These items corresponded to the four factors previously identified in the 33-item scale (minus the 'Mistrust' subscale). Confirmatory factor analysis was used to validate the structure of the CSS-12. Confirmatory bifactor modeling indicated that the majority of item covariance was accounted for by a general cyberchondria factor. Construct validity was assessed by examining associations with the SHAI and GAD-7, with stronger correlations observed between the CSS-12 and the SHAI (compared with the GAD-7). The CSS-12 is a brief, reliable, and valid measure of worry/anxiety attributable to excessive online health research.

The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to post-infusion 4 on the Quick Inventory for Depression Symptomatology-Self Report-16 (QIDS-SR16; n = 190). Secondary measures included QIDS-SR₁₆-measured response and remission rates, changes from baseline to endpoint in Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale (GAD-7; n = 188) and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS; n = 168). Results: Significant improvement in total depressive symptoms severity (p < 0.0001) was observed after four infusions of IV ketamine 0.5–0.75 mg/kg. Moreover, the response rate (QIDS-SR₁₆ total score change ≥ 50%) was 27% and remission (QIDS-SR₁₆ total score ≤ 5) rate was 13%. Patients receiving IV ketamine exhibited anxiolytic effects (p < 0.0001,), improved overall psychosocial function (p < 0.0001), and reduced suicidal ideation (p < 0.0001). Compared to the baseline infusion, dissociation severity significantly reduced in subsequent infusions. Limitations: This was a naturalistic, retrospective study, without a control group. Conclusions: IV ketamine was safe, well-tolerated, and effective at improving depressive, anxiety, and functional impairment symptoms in a well-characterized cohort of adults with TRD.

We sought to: (1) assess the effects of an online mindfulness intervention on perceived stress, depression and anxiety; (2) assess different facets of mindfulness (i.e. acting with awareness, describing, non-judging and non-reacting) as mechanisms of change and (3) assess whether the effect of the intervention was maintained over time. The sample was comprised of 118 adults (female, n = 95) drawn from the general population. Using a randomised waitlist control design, participants were randomised to either an intervention (INT) or waitlist control (WLC) group. Participants completed the online intervention, with the WLC group starting after a 6-week waitlist period. Participants completed measures of depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7) and perceived stress (PSS-10) at baseline, post-treatment, 3- and 6-month follow-up. Participants who completed the mindfulness intervention (n = 60) reported significantly lower levels of perceived stress (d = − 1.25 [− 1.64, − 0.85]), anxiety (d = − 1.09 [− 1.47, − 0.98]) and depression (d = − 1.06 [− 1.44, − 0.67]), when compared with waitlist control participants (n = 58), and these effects were maintained at follow-up. The effect of the intervention was primarily explained by increased levels of non-judging. This study provides support for online mindfulness interventions and furthers our understanding with regards to how mindfulness interventions exert their positive effects.

Dream disturbances, such as frequent nightmares and dream anxiety, are associated with a variety of psychopathological conditions. Therefore, it is important to consider nightmares and the resulting dream anxiety. To address this issue, the Van Dream Anxiety Scale (VDAS) was designed especially for measuring nightmare frequency and dream anxiety caused by frightening dreams. As a Chinese version of VDAS may be helpful in promoting study of nightmare and dream anxiety among Chinese population, in the current study, we sought to develop a Chinese version of the VDAS (CVDAS). Methods: We translated the VDAS into Chinese. To evaluate its validity and reliability, a sample of 1,081 Chinese college students from two universities answered the CVDAS, GAD-7, PHQ-9 and EPQ-R-N. Ninety of them answered the CVDAS twice. We also conducted exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to explore the structure of CVDAS. Results: Excellent internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was 0.926), split-half reliability (equal-length Spearman–Brown coefficient was 0.938) and good test–retest reliability (the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.942 and t = -1.478, P = 0.143) of the CVDAS was presented. Exploratory factor analyses indicated a two-factor structure: sleep-related disturbances caused by nightmares and dysfunction caused by nightmares. Convergent and divergent validities were acceptable. Conclusion: The CVDAS shows promise for the measurement of nightmare frequency and specific dream anxiety in Chinese population. Future study should confirm the reliability and validity in the clinical population and further improve this scale.

To detect patients with pathological levels, appropriate screeners with established cut‐offs are needed. Given that previous research is sparse, we investigated the diagnostic accuracy of 2 frequently used screening tools in detecting generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Methods: We used data of a multicenter study including 2141 cancer patients. Diagnostic accuracy was investigated for the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener (GAD‐7) and the anxiety module of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS‐A). GAD, assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview for Oncology, served as a reference standard. Overall accuracy was measured with the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). The AUC of the 2 screeners were statistically compared. We also calculated accuracy measures for selected cut‐offs. Results: Diagnostic accuracy could be interpreted as adequate for both screeners, with an identical AUC of .81 (95% CI: .79‐.82). Consequently, the 2 screeners did not differ in their performance (P = .86). The best balance between sensitivity and specificity was found for cut‐offs ≥ 7 (GAD‐7) and ≥ 8 (HADS‐A). The officially recommended thresholds for the GAD‐7 (≥ 10) and the HADS‐A (≥ 11) showed low sensitivities of 55% and 48%, respectively. Conclusions: The GAD‐7 and HADS‐A showed AUC of adequate diagnostic accuracy and hence are applicable for GAD screening in cancer patients. Nevertheless, the choice of optimal cut‐offs should be carefully evaluated.

However, the mechanisms of how exposure to early trauma shapes the risk of PLEs are unclear. In our study, we investigated whether borderline personality features and further non-psychotic symptoms, i.e. factors related to both PLEs and childhood trauma, may mediate the relationship between childhood trauma and PLEs. Methods: Two hundred inpatients aged 16–21 years who were treated due to non-psychotic disorders were included. PLEs were assessed with the Prodromal Questionnaire (PQ-16). Childhood Trauma was assessed with the Adverse Childhood Experience Questionnaire (ACE). Borderline personality features were assessed by using the Borderline-Symptom Checklist (BSL-23). Presence and frequency of depressive symptoms and anxiety were assessed by Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7). Results: A significant relationship between childhood trauma (ACE total score) and PLEs was found (ß = 0.30, 95% CI 0.247--0.659). In particular, emotional neglect (r = 0.298, p < 0.001) and sexual abuse (r = 0.264, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with PLEs. Borderline personality features fully mediated the relationship of childhood trauma and PLEs (ß = 0.12, 95% CI: -0.019-0.370). Anxiety and Depression showed a significant, but partial mediation of the relationship. Conclusion: Borderline personality features seem to be an important mediator of the relationship between childhood trauma and PLEs in adolescent patients with different non-psychotic psychiatric disorders. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed.

However, longitudinal follow-up designs are widely lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the change of the prevalence of mental disorders among Syrian refugees with German residence permission, taking into account their increasing length of stay in Germany, and to uncover the change in their relationship to pre- and post-migration risk factors. Methods: This study formed part of a register-based follow-up study with two measurement points in Erlangen (Germany). At the first time of recruitment in 2017, 200 of the 518 Syrian refugees with residence permission living in Erlangen took part. During the second survey timeframe 1.5 years later, in 2019, 108 of the former 200 Syrian refugees participated again and formed the total sample for this follow-up study. The survey instruments included demographics, migration-related variables and symptoms of post-traumatic stress (Essen Trauma Inventory, ETI), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire - PHQ-9) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7). Results: At the time of the first survey, 26.9% of the participants exceeded the cut-off for a clinically relevant depression diagnosis, 16.7% for an anxiety disorder and 13.9% for a PTSD diagnosis. At the second measurement point, it was 30.6% for depression, 15.7% for an anxiety disorder and 13.0% for PTSD. No significant changes between the measurement points were found for any of the disorders. In multiple linear regression analyses, higher perceived discrimination, a higher number of traumatic experiences and a shorter duration of residence permission were shown to be the most important pre- and post-migration predictors of psychological stress independent of the time of measurement. Conclusions: There is strong empirical evidence that the prevalence rates of mental distress among refugees are significantly higher compared to the overall population. However, it has not yet become clear how these prevalence rates change with an increasing length of stay in the host countries. The results of our study indicate that the psychological burden on this refugee population remains consistently high over time, despite partly improved living conditions, and confirm the importance of therapeutic interventions.

The Chinese healthcare system is facing a big challenge where hospital workers are experiencing enormous psychological pressure. This study aimed to (1) investigate the psychological status of hospital workers and (2) provide references for psychological crisis intervention in the future. Method: An online survey was conducted to collect sociodemographic features, epidemic-related factors, results of PHQ-9, GAD-7, PHQ-15, suicidal and self-harm ideation (SSI), and the score of stress and support scales. Chi-square test, t-test, non-parametric, and logistic regression analysis were used to detect the risk factors to psychological effect and SSI. Results: 8817 hospital workers participated in this online survey. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, and SSI were 30.2%, 20.7%, 46.2%, and 6.5%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that female, single, Tujia minority, educational background of junior or below, designated or county hospital, need for psychological assistance before or during the epidemic, unconfident about defeating COVID-19, ignorance about the epidemic, willingness of attending parties, and poor self-rated health condition were independent factors associated with high-level depression, somatic symptom, and SSI among hospital workers (P < 0.05). Limitations: This cross-sectional study cannot reveal the causality, and voluntary participation could be prone to selection bias. A modified epidemic-related stress and support scale without standardization was used. The number of hospital workers in each hospital was unavailable. Conclusion: There were a high level of psychological impact and SSI among hospital workers, which needed to be addressed. County hospital workers were more severe and easier to be neglected. More studies on cognitive and behavioral subsequence after a public health disaster among hospital workers are needed.

Both programs have been associated with substantial symptom reductions from pre- to post-treatment. The present study extends these findings by investigating symptom levels at 12 months post-treatment, as well as treatment outcome in relation to low- vs. high-intensity treatment forms. Design and Outcome Measures: A prospective cohort design was used. All participants (n = 1530) were asked to complete the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 questionnaire (GAD-7) at baseline, before each session during treatment, at final treatment, and at 12 months post-treatment. Cohen’s d was used as effect size measure. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the impact of the high missing data rates at post-treatment (≈44%) and 12 months post-treatment (≈58%). Results: A large symptom reduction was seen from baseline to 12 months post-treatment for both PHQ (d = −0.98) and GAD (d = −0.94). Improvements observed at post-treatment were largely maintained at 12 months post-treatment (PHQ (Δd = 0.10) and GAD (Δd = 0.09). Recovery rates decreased only slightly from 49.5% at post-treatment to 45.0% at follow-up. Both low- and high-intensity treatment forms were associated with substantial and lasting symptoms reductions (−1.26 ≤ d ≤ −0.73). Sensitivity analyses did not substantially alter the main results.

Digital modalities that operate outside session-based treatment formats, such as ongoing two-way messaging, may further address these challenges. However, no study to date has established suitability criteria for this medium. Methods: A large outpatient sample (n = 10,718) engaged in daily messaging with licensed clinicians from a telemedicine provider. Patients consisted of individuals from urban and rural settings in all 50 states of the US, who signed up to the telemedicine provider. Using a longitudinal design, symptoms changes were observed during a 12 week treatment course. Symptoms were assessed from baseline every three weeks using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) for anxiety. Demographics and engagement metrics, such as word count for both patients and therapists, were also assessed. Growth mixture modeling was used to tease apart symptoms trajectories, and identify predictors of treatment response. Results: Two subpopulations had GAD-7 and PHQ-9 remission outcomes (Recovery and Acute Recovery, 30.7% of patients), while two others showed amelioration of symptoms (Depression and Anxiety Improvement, 36.9% of patients). Two subpopulations experienced no changes in symptoms (Chronic and Elevated Chronic, 32.4% of patients). Higher use of written communication, patient characteristics, and engagement metrics reliably distinguished patients with the greatest level of remission (Recovery and Acute Recovery groups). Conclusions: Remission of depression and anxiety symptoms was observed during delivery of psychotherapy through messaging. Improvement rates were consistent with face-to-face therapy, suggesting the suitability of two-way messaging psychotherapy delivery. Characteristics of improving patients were identified and could be used for treatment recommendation. These findings suggest the opportunity for further research, to directly compare messaging delivery with a control group of treatment as usual.

Based on scores on the Korean Smartphone Addiction Proneness Scale for Adults (S-Scale), 974 smartphone users were assigned to the smartphone-dependent group and 4398 users were assigned to the normal group. The data-mining technique of C5.0 decision tree was applied. We used 15 input variables, including demographic and psychological factors. Four psychiatric variables emerged as the most important predictors: self-control (Sc; 66%), anxiety (Anx; 25%), depression (Dep; 7%), and dysfunctional impulsivities (Imp; 3%). We identified the following five types of problematic smartphone use: (1) non-comorbid, (2) self-control, (3) Sc + Anx, (4) Sc + Anx + Dep, and (5) Sc + Anx + Dep + Imp. We found that 74% of smartphone-dependent users had psychiatric symptoms. The ratio of participants belonging to the non-comorbid and self-control types was 64%. We proposed that these types of problematic smartphone use may be used for the development of an appropriate service for controlling and preventing such behaviors in adults.

However, adherence to a study protocol may not completely capture a key aspect of why participants engage with eMH tools, namely, to achieve personal mental health goals. As a consequence, trial attrition reported as non-adherence or dropout may reflect e-attainment, the discontinuation of eMH engagement after personal goals have been met. Clarifying engagement patterns, such as e-attainment, and how these align with mental health trajectories, may help optimize eMH design and implementation science. Objective: This study aimed to use clustering techniques to identify real-world engagement profiles in a community of eMH users and examine if such engagement profiles are associated with different mental health outcomes. The novelty of this approach was our attempt to identify actual user engagement behaviors, as opposed to employing engagement benchmarks derived from a trial protocol. The potential of this approach is to link naturalistic behaviors to beneficial mental health outcomes, which would be especially informative when designing eMH programs for the general public. Methods: Between May 2013 and June 2018, Australian adults (N = 43,631) signed up to myCompass, a self-guided eMH program designed to help alleviate mild to moderate symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Recorded usage data included number of logins, frequency of mood tracking, number of started and completed learning activities, and number of tracking reminders set. A subset of users (n = 168) completed optional self-assessment mental health questionnaires (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item, PHQ-9; Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire-7 item, GAD-7) at registration and at 28 and 56 days after sign-up. Another subset of users (n = 861) completed the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 at registration and at 28 days. Results: Two-step cluster analyses revealed 3 distinct usage patterns across both subsamples: moderates, trackers, and super users, signifying differences both in the frequency of use as well as differences in preferences for program functionalities. For both subsamples, repeated measures analysis of variances showed significant decreases over time in PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores. Time-by-cluster interactions, however, did not yield statistical significance in both subsamples, indicating that clusters did not predict symptom reduction over time. Interestingly, users who completed the self-assessment questionnaires twice had slightly but significantly lower depression and anxiety levels at sign-up compared with users who completed the questionnaires a third time at 56 days. Conclusions: Findings suggested that although users engaged with myCompass in different but measurable ways, those different usage patterns evoked equivalent mental health benefits. Furthermore, the randomized controlled trial paradigm may unintentionally limit the scope of eMH engagement research by mislabeling early mental health goal achievers as dropouts. More detailed and naturalistic approaches to study engagement with eMH technologies may improve program design and, ultimately, program effectiveness.

Methods: YYFcore03, Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ‐9], and Generalized Anxiety Disorder [GAD‐7] were administered to 608 patients in out‐patient clinics. A subset of 158 patients responding a second time to YYFcore03 at a subsequent visit were included for assessing reliability. Exploratory factor analysis followed by confirmatory factor analysis were conducted to identify underlying factors. The identified factor of psychological distress (PD) was then correlated with PHQ‐9 and GAD‐7 for concurrent validity and to estimate sensitivity‐specificity. Demographic and clinical variables associated with the PD score were identified. Test‐retest reliability of PD score was examined. Results: Factor analysis suggested three factors, including PD. Correlations between PD score and PHQ‐9 and GAD‐7 were 0.63 and 0.67, respectively. Treating PHQ‐9 and GAD‐7 as criterion measures, PD score had a sensitivity of 0.77 for identifying depression and 0.86 for identifying anxiety. Younger age, lower household income, and cancer (vs noncancer) diagnosis were independently associated with worse PD score. Omega total for composite reliability was 0.88; intraclass correlation was 0.78.

The current study reports on the validity of the US-based equating procedures for the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Kessler 6 psychological distress scale (K6) to equate scores in a large online sample of Australian adults. Methods: Data comprised 3175 Australians recruited online. Each participant provided responses to the PROMIS depression and anxiety item banks, the PHQ-9, the GAD-7 and the K6. Two scoring methods were used to convert the scores on the PHQ-9, GAD-7 and K6 to the PROMIS depression and anxiety metrics. The converted scores were compared to the PROMIS depression and anxiety scores using intraclass correlations, mean difference, mean of absolute differences and Bland–Altman limits of agreement. Results: Statistically significant mean differences were identified in five out of eight equated scores, albeit the effect sizes were small (Cohen’s d z ≤ 0.25). The correlations were uniformly high (ICC ≥ 0.86). The mean of absolute differences between observed and equated scores for each metric and across scoring methods ranged between 4.23 and 5.33. Conclusions: The results demonstrate the validity of generating PROMIS depression and anxiety scores from the PHQ-9, GAD-7 and K6 in an independent sample of Australians. The agreement between equated scores provides some assurance that researchers and clinicians can utilise the converted PHQ-9, GAD-7 and K6 scores on the PROMIS metrics without a substantial decrease in accuracy and precision at the group level.

The identification of influencing factors is important to implement appropriate prevention strategies. This study analyzes influencing factors on the subjective prognosis of long-term vocational disability in German teaching staff. Methods: In this cross-sectional study we analyzed medical records of N= 515 teachers and educational staff who had attended an occupational medical/psychological consultation between 2011 and 2016. The majority were women (73.0%; n = 375), the mean age was 49.6 (SD = 9.1) years. We used a comprehensive set of measures: work-related demands (Wuerzburg Screening) to identify occupational problems, vocational disability (SPE) and depression/anxiety (PHQ-9, GAD-7). Results: Subjective prognosis of long-term vocational disability was significantly related to age, years of service, several work related strains as well as mental health symptoms. Significant predictors in a multiple logistic regression model were age (OR: 1.06), ‘limited vocational capability‘ (OR: 1.65) and ‘being loaded by work‘ (OR: 1.56). Conclusion: Professionals who are concerned with occupational health management should consider those factors in order to prevent or delay early retirement. Persons who are at high risk for early retirement should receive specific trainings or brief psychotherapeutic interventions.
